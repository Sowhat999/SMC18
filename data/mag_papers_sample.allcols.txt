post-transcriptional mitochondrial RNA modification phenomenon required for viability of trypanosomatid parasites. Small guide RNAs encoded mainly by the thousands of catenated minicircles contain the information for this editing. We analyzed by NGS technology the mitochondrial genomes and transcriptomes of two strains, the old lab UC strain and the recently isolated LEM125 strain. PacBio sequencing provided complete minicircle sequences which avoided the assembly problem of short reads caused by the conserved regions. Minicircles were identified by a characteristic size, the presence of three short conserved sequences, a region of inherently bent DNA and the presence of single gRNA genes at a fairly defined location. The LEM125 strain contained over 114 minicircles encoding different gRNAs and the UC strain only ~24 minicircles. Some LEM125 minicircles contained no identifiable gRNAs. Approximate copy numbers of the different minicircle classes in the network were determined by the number of PacBio CCS reads that assembled to each class. Mitochondrial RNA libraries from both strains were mapped against the minicircle and maxicircle sequences. Small RNA reads mapped to the putative gRNA genes but also to multiple regions outside the genes on both strands and large RNA reads mapped in many cases over almost the entire minicircle on both strands. These data suggest that minicircle transcription is complete and bidirectional, with 3’ processing yielding the mature gRNAs. Steady state RNAs in varying abundances are derived from all maxicircle genes, including portions of the repetitive divergent region. The relative extents of editing in both strains correlated with the presence of a cascade of cognate gRNAs. These data should provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of this dynamic genetic system as well as the evolutionary variation of editing in different strains."qwqwLarry Simpson,Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America;Stephen Douglass,Bioinformatics Interdepartmental Program, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America|||Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America;James A.

We then analyze our results using the automated summary evaluation technique known as ROUGE-2, with our ROUGE-2 scores averaging 8.01.

The methods of analytical geometry and trigonometry were used to calculate an optimal in-run hill profile. There were two fundamental conditions of the model: smooth borders between a curvilinear segment and straight-line segments of an in-run hill and concave of the curvilinear segment. Within the framework of this model, the problem has been solved with a reasonable precision. Four functions of a curvilinear segment profile of the in-run hill were investigated: circle arc, inclined quadratic parabola, inclined cubic parabola, and power function. The application of a power function to the in-run profile satisfies equal conditions for replacing a circle arc segment.

With 24 w/v % EC in ethanol as electrospinnable core fluid and ethanol as sheath fluid, EC nanofibers generated under different sheath flow rates were generated from the modified processes. FESEM observations demonstrate that the modified process is effective in preventing the clogging of spinneret for a smooth electrospinning. The key for the modified coaxial process is the reasonable selection of a sheath flow rate matching the drawing process of core EC fluid during the electrpospinning. The EC nanofibers’ diameters (D, nm) could be manipulated through the sheath-to-core flow rate ratio (f) as D = 819-1651f (R= 0.9754) within a suitable range of 0 to 0.25. The present paper provides useful data for the implementation of the modified coaxial process controllably to obtain polymer nanofibers with high quality."qwqwDeng-Guang Yu;Xiong-Xiu Li;Jia-Wen Ge;Pengpeng Ye;Xia Wang

We aimed to use molecular genotyping to assess antimalarial drug resistance selection and spread in the Greater Mekong subregion.  Methods  In this observational study, we tested  Plasmodium falciparum  isolates from Myanmar, northeastern Thailand, southern Laos, and western Cambodia for  PfKelch13  mutations and for  Pfplasmepsin2  gene amplification (indicating piperaquine resistance). We collected blood spots from patients with microscopy or rapid test confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria. We used microsatellite genotyping to assess genetic relatedness.  Findings  As part of studies on the epidemiology of artemisinin-resistant malaria between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015, we collected 434 isolates. In 2014–15, a single long  PfKelch13  C580Y haplotype (−50 to +31·5 kb) lineage, which emerged in western Cambodia in 2008, was detected in 65 of 88 isolates from northeastern Thailand, 86 of 111 isolates from southern Laos, and 14 of 14 isolates from western Cambodia, signifying a hard transnational selective sweep.  Pfplasmepsin2  amplification occurred only within this lineage, and by 2015 these closely related parasites were found in ten of the 14 isolates from Cambodia and 15 of 15 isolates from northeastern Thailand. C580Y mutated parasites from Myanmar had a different genetic origin.  Interpretation  Our results suggest that the dominant artemisinin-resistant  P falciparum  C580Y lineage probably arose in western Cambodia and then spread to Thailand and Laos, outcompeting other parasites and acquiring piperaquine resistance. The emergence and spread of fit artemisinin-resistant  P falciparum  parasite lineages, which then acquire partner drug resistance across the Greater Mekong subregion, threatens regional malaria control and elimination goals. Elimination of falciparum malaria from this region should be accelerated while available antimalarial drugs still remain effective.

These studies were carried out by those leading representatives of 18th-century physico-mathematical sciences, the Petersburg Academicians Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler. While working in Petersburg, Bernoulli and Euler simultaneously set out to develop the science of fluid motion on the basis of the law of conservation of living forces (kinetic energy). When their first results turned out to be identical, Euler conceded the right to pursue further studies in this field to his older colleague. As a result, at the beginning of the 1730's, Bernoulli laid the foundations of theoretical hydraulics on the basis of the law of living forces balance, which in his treatment approximated the law of energy conservation. Bernoulli published his theory of hydraulics in his famous Hydrodynamics (1738), the most significant treatise on physical mechanics to appear in the 18th century.

It arises during blastula stages through the combined influences of dorsal modifying signals and general mesendoderm inducers. Dorsal modifying signals require the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, but how this is initiated remained a mystery until recently. New findings now demonstrate that maternal Wnt11 activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and is essential for organizer formation. Furthermore, two of the earliest identified mesendoderm inducers, activin and Vg-1, have now been shown to be required for induction of a fully functional organizer. Finally, while it has been clear for a number of years that the Organizer secretes a cocktail of growth factor antagonists, their necessity for organizer function has been in question. Their requirement has now been demonstrated through a multiple “knockdown” approach in frog embryos. Here, we discuss the impact these recent findings have on our understanding of formation and function of the Organizer."qwqwStéphanie Lebreton,Centre for Molecular Medicine, 61 Biopolis Way, Singapore 138673, Singapore;C.

Male Wistar rats were fed 1 g/kg body weight/day ethanol (20%) solution orally for 3 months and folate transport was studied in the isolated colon apical membrane vesicles. The folate transport was found to be carrier mediated, saturable, with pH optima at 5.0. Chronic ethanol ingestion reduced the folate transport across the CAM by decreasing the affinity of transporters (high Km) for the substrate and by decreasing the number of transporter molecules (low Vmax) on the colon luminal surface. The decreased transport activity at the CAM was associated with down-regulation of the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) and the reduced folate carrier (RFC) which resulted in decreased PCFT and RFC protein levels in the colon of rats fed alcohol chronically. Moreover, the PCFT and the RFC were found to be distributed in detergent insoluble fraction of the CAM in rats. Floatation experiments on Optiprep density gradients demonstrated the association of the PCFT and the RFC protein with lipid rafts (LR). Chronic alcoholism decreased the PCFT and the RFC protein levels in the CAM LR in accordance with the decreased synthesis. Hence, we propose that downregulation in the expression of the PCFT and the RFC in colon results in reduced levels of these transporters in colon apical membrane LR as a mechanism of folate malabsorption during chronic alcoholism.

The aim of the present study was to examine the 3-D hydrodynamic characteristics (3-D wave field, wave height, mean water level, and mean flow) around the asymmetric submerged breakwaters using a 3-D numerical model, LES-WASS-3D, which was validated through a comparison with existing experimental data and showed fairly nice agreement. From the numerical results, the wave height, mean water level, and mean flow are discussed in relation with the variation in the breakwater length ratio."qwqw이우동;허동수;서성부

The periodic motions of the legs are generated as a rhyhmic motion. The stability of locomotion strongly depends on the mechanical properties of the body mechanism, especially the joint stiffness.

Compared with nonproblem drinkers, late-onset problem drinkers consumed more alcohol and functioned more poorly; they also reported more negative life events and chronic stressors, fewer social resources, and more use of avoidance coping. However, late-onset problem drinkers consumed less alcohol, had fewer drinking problems, functioned better, and had more benign life contexts than did early-onset problem drinkers. We found no evidence of an association between age-related loss events and the onset of late-life drinking problems. Very few problem drinkers sought help specifically for their alcohol abuse, but about 25% did seek treatment from mental health practitioners. Problem drinkers who were functioning more poorly and who reported more life stressors and fewer social resources were more likely to seek help."qwqwPenny L.

To get the optimum wheel design, the wheel traction performance should be predicted   before constructing the wheel. The purpose of this research were 1) to develop a prediction method of lug   wheel performance, 2) to analyze the performance of lug wheel, and 3) to select the best configuration of   lug wheel design. Tractive performance prediction method was developed based on the forces acting on   active lugs when the wheel operates in the soil. Soil reaction forces to wheel lugs were predicted using   measured data of soil resistance on plat penetration in the soil. Nine wheel designs were tested in a   paddy field to validate the prediction of wheel traction performance. The results showed that the developed   prediction method developed had not approached the wheel traction efficiency maesurement results. The   wheel traction efficiency prediction showed a high level of error that was more than 65%. The best wheel   design for the paddy field was determined from the highest average measurement value of the wheel   traction efficiency i.e 47.81%, that was the wheel with 12 lugs and 30° lug angle.          Abstrak  Kondisi lahan sawah merupakan faktor penting yang perlu dipertimbangkan dalam perancangan roda besi bersirip untuk pengolahan tanah. Untuk mendapatkan desain roda besi bersirip yang optimal, kinerja traksi harus diduga sebelum melakukan perancangan. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah 1) untuk mengembangkan sebuah metode pendugaan kinerja traksi roda besi bersirip, 2) untuk menganalisis kinerja traksi roda besi bersirip, 3) untuk menentukan konfigurasi desain roda besi bersirip terbaik. Metoda untuk menduga kinerja traksi dikembangkan berdasarkan gaya-gaya reaksi yang bekerja pada sirip aktif pada saat roda besi bersirip beroperasi di lahan. Gaya reaksi tanah pada sirip roda diduga dengan menggunakan data pengukuran tahanan tanah terhadap penetrasi plat. Sebanyak 9 buah tipe desain roda besi bersirip telah diuji pada lahan sawah untuk memvalidasi hasil pendugaan kinerja traksi roda besi bersirip. Hasil validasi menunjukkan bahwa efisiensi traksi hasil pengembangan metode pendugaan belum mendekati hasil efisiensi traksi pengukuran. Pendugaan efisiensi traksi roda besi bersirip menghasilkan tingkat error yang tinggi yaitu lebih dari 65%. Desain roda besi bersirip terbaik untuk lahan sawah ditentukan dari ratarata nilai efisiensi traksi hasil pengukuran tertinggi sebesar 47.81% yaitu roda besi bersirip dengan jumlah sirip 12 dan sudut sirip 30°."qwqwMuhammad Taufiq,Program Studi Teknik Mesin Pertanian dan Pangan, Institut Pertanian Bogor.;Tineke Mandang,Departemen Teknik Mesin dan Biosistem, Institut Pertanian Bogor.;Wawan Hermawan,Departemen Teknik Mesin dan Biosistem Institut Pertanian Bogor.

The d33 of the converse effect was determined from the electric-field induced strain. In the measurement of the direct effect, a sinusoidal stress was applied to the sample using a piezoelectric actuator and the polarization generated by the direct effect was detected as a displacement current. The degree of the domain contribution was estimated from the difference in the piezoelectric d33 constants determined from the resonance method and that from the converse or the direct effect. The domain contribution was larger in the soft-PZT than in the hard-PZT. The d33 determined from the two effects was consistent in the soft-PZT but the d33 of the hard-PZT determined from the direct effect was markedly larger than that from the converse effect or the resonance method. These results indicated that a fairly large degree of the domain contribution existed in the direct effect of the hard-PZT, and that the mechanism of the domain wall clamping did not work effectively in the direct effect."qwqwTakaaki Tsurumi;Tsutomu Sasaki;Hirofumi Kakemoto;Takakiyo Harigai;Satoshi Wada

Retention of beta2-microglobulin (β2m) is the prerequisite; biochemical alterations of β32m increasing its amyloidogenicity, and local predisposing tissue factors together with age appear to be relevant. A growing body of evidence points toward the importance of pro-inflammatory effects of dialysis (blood-membrane interactions, pyrogen-related priming of cytokine producing mononuclear cells) in the development of DRA. Advanced glycation endproduct formation (AGE-β2m) may represent a central element in the pathogenesis of DRA. For non-transplant therapy of DRA, the main goals must be the optimization of β2m removal (high-flux haemodialysis, haemofiltration, especially pre-dilution haemofiltration) and reduction of pro-inflammatory effects of dialysis (use of non-complement activating biocompatible membranes, pyrogen free dialysate). At least patients at high risk for DRA should be treated according to these guidelines."qwqwJ. Schaeffer,Division of Nephrology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany;G.

The authors of this book state that this resource could be exploited to produce a large fraction of the world's energy needs in the form of methanol or ammonia and that any associated deleterious environmental effects would be minimal. Careful analyses of potential problems, detailed designs of OTEC plant ships, and consideration of costs occupy most of the book. Part of it is devoted to some limited practical experience. With the knowledge set forth a 40-MWe seagoing pilot plant could be constructed. Cost would be about $200 million in 1990 dollars. Construction could be relatively rapid, since most of the components would be commercially available. The authors provide extensive evidence that with experience costs of OTEC would be substantially reduced and that ultimately production of methanol and ammonia by OTEC could be made cost-competitive."qwqwWilliam H.

Substituting the exact analytical expression of the Green’s function into the Helmholtz–Kirchhoff integral equation and using the method of moments, the scattered fields from a ground with barriers or troughs in such a medium are computed.

The term Econophysics was formally born in Kolkata in 1995. The entry on Econophysics in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Ed., Vol 2, Macmillan, NY (2008), pp 729-732, begins with "... the term 'econophysics' was neologized in 1995 at the second Statphys- Kolkata conference in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India ...". The Econophysics research therefore formally completes fifteen years of research by the end of this year! The importance and proliferation of the interdisciplinary research of Econophysics is highlighted in the special issue of Science & Culture, which presents a collection of twenty nine papers (giving country wise perspectives, reviews of the recent developments and original research communications), written by more than forty renowned experts in physics, mathematics or economics, from all over the world.

During the process of skin irritation intracellular enzymes migrate into the culture medium. The amount of released enzyme activity corresponds to the degree of skin damage. Skin of hairless mice (hr/hr) has been found to be especially useful for this model. Histomorphology demonstrated that the explants were almost identical to the  in vivo  situation. Skin explants of hairless mice of 50 mm 2  were used for the tests. The dermal side of the skin is in contact with the medium whereas the substance is applied to the epidermal side and incubated for 24 hr. As parameters for the membrane-damaging effect, the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic-oxaloacetate transaminase were measured. The determination of the glucose utilization during the incubation period gave additional information about the viability of the cultured skin. Various chemicals were used. Histological examination complemented the biochemical results and differentiated epidermal lesions, but was limited by the absence of inflammatory reactions of the dermal part of the skin. Overall,  in vitro  skin culture tests seem to be useful as screening tests prior to  in vivo  studies and for the development of new formulations."qwqwBartnik Fg;W.

The types of noise studied are: (1) One-dimensional periodic noise (banding); (2) One-dimensional random noise (streaking) and, (3) Two-dimensional random noise (grain). A spectral separation technique was developed which allows the estimation of the individual noise power spectrum (NPS) of each artifact, based on the original flat field data. We proceed by assuming that the components are additive. First, the one-dimensional periodic components are identified, quantified, and removed from the flat field scan. Then the residual one-dimensional and two-dimensional random noise components are estimated via analysis of the twodimensional NPS. This technique is useful in the characterization of digital cameras, printers, and scanners."qwqwPaul J. Kane;Theodore F. Bouk;Peter D. Burns;Andrew D. Thompson

The system incorporates quantum-dot photon detectors into a scanning confocal optical microscope. Minimal requirements for practical application have been fulfilled by improving the operation speed of photon detection by a factor of 100, expanding the operation temperatures beyond 0.3 K and achieving a dynamic range more than 30dB. We use this microscope to probe extremely weak cyclotron emission with less than femto-watt powers radiated from quantum Hall effect devices, which leads to direct visualization of nonequilibrium electrons generated between Landau levels."qwqwKenji Ikushima,Dept. of Basic Sci., Tokyo Univ., Japan;T.

All these bands are broad and nearly featureless, and have widths at half height ranging from 75 to 148 cm −1 . With one possible exception they appear to be free from Fermi resonances. By least-squares fitting of the theoretical bandshape function derived in part I to the experimental spectra we have been able to estimate the parameters Δ, ω 2 , and τ C  which characterise the theoretical autocorrelation function, and also to determine the  v  s (XH) stretching frequency very accurately. In the case of phenol (OD)-dioxan in CCl 4  the discrepancies between the observed and fitted spectra can be entirely attributed to errors of observation. It is found that the Kubo parameter τ C  Δ is close to unity in all cases, showing that the  v  s (XH) bands are subject to partial (but not extreme) motional narrowing. The  v  σ (XH⋯Y) vibration is always heavily damped and has a broad spectral density. The changes in the spectral profiles produced by deuteration and change of solvent are easily understood in terms of the theory. Deuteration affects the amplitude of modulation, while changing the solvent affects the value of τ C . In either case τ C Δ changes, and the speed of modulation is altered. Since the system is far from the gaussian (slow modulation) limit, the bandshape changes markedly in consequence."qwqwJ. Yarwood;R.T. Ackroyd;G.N. Robertson

It remains a challenge if women’s reproductive autonomy will be at the centre of the debate."qwqwLidia Casas Becerra;Lieta Vivaldi Macho

In India, where caste hierarchy has reinforced power for generations, the disruptive potential of the mobile phone is even more striking than elsewhere. In 2001, India had 35 million telephones, only four million of them mobiles. Ten years later, it had more than 800 million phone subscribers; more than 95 per cent were mobile phones. In a decade, communications in India have been transformed by a device that can be shared by fisherfolk in Kerala, boatmen in Banaras, great capitalists in Mumbai and powerwielding politicians and bureaucrats in New Delhi. Village councils banned unmarried girls from having mobile phones. Families debated whether new brides should surrender them. Cheap mobile phones became photo albums, music machines and radios. Religious images and uplifting messages flooded tens of millions of phones each day. Pornographers and criminals found a tantalising new tool. In politics, organisations with cadres of truebelievers exploited a resource infinitely more effective than telegrams, postcards and the printing press for carrying messages to workers, followers and voters. Jeffrey and Doron focus on three groups - controllers: the bureaucrats, politicians and capitalists who wrestle over control of radio frequency spectrum; servants: the marketers, agents, technicians, tower-builders, repairers and second-hand dealers who carry mobile phones to the masses; and users: the politicians, activists, businesses and households that adapt the mobile phone to their needs. The book probes the whole universe of the mobile phone - from the contests of great capitalists and governments to control radio frequency spectrum to the ways ordinary people build the troublesome, addictive device into their daily lives."qwqwRobin Jeffrey;Assa Doron

proposed. h4icrostrnctural damage occurs primarily in a process zone determined by the solder joint geomehy. Within this process zone, the microstrnctural surface relief and the location of the fmal fracture plane indicate that damage is localized at a) the Sn-Pb phase boundaries and b) the grain boundaries within the Sn-rich phase. Results suggest that surface relief at grain and phase boundaries could be an appropriate early indicator of damage while recrystallization is a prelude to impending fracture in monotonic, isothermal shear loadmg. The critical nominal shear strain for this particular CSP/solder combination was found to be 4.7%. Examples are provided to illustrate how such a measure of damage initiation can be used as a design criterion."qwqwS. Canumalla,Nokia Mobile Phones;Sesil Mathew;Sambit K. Saha

Our results show that some bulk properties have a relevent impact on wafer performances. For instance, the reliability of thin oxide is found to be sensitive to variations of initial interstitial oxygen concentration within a rather narrow range. Epitaxial substrates give the best performances, provided suitable extrinsic gettering is used. On the contrary the behavior of thin oxides is found not to be very sensitive to the status (in terms of light point defects) of the wafer surface at the beginning of the device process."qwqwE.

The analyzed variables include age, sex, comorbidity, grade of stenosis, length of resected trachea, and communication methods.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Methods:#R##N##R##N#Data regarding the children's pre- and postsurgical communication methods, along with their utilization of speech therapy services, were obtained via speech–language pathology evaluations, clinical observations, and a standardized telephone survey supplemented by parental documentation. Postsurgical voice quality was assessed using the Pediatric Voice Outcomes Survey.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Results:#R##N##R##N#All seven subjects underwent tracheostomy prior to 2 months of age when corrected for prematurity. The subjects remained aphonic for the entire duration of cannulation. Following cricotracheal resection, they experienced an initial delay in speech acquisition. Vegetative functions were the first laryngeal sounds to emerge. Initially, the children were only able to produce these sounds reflexively, but they subsequently gained voluntary control over these laryngeal functions. All subjects underwent an identifiable stage of canonical babbling that often occurred concomitantly with vocalizations. This was followed by the emergence of true speech.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Conclusions:#R##N##R##N#The initial delay in speech acquisition observed following decannulation, along with the presence of a postsurgical canonical stage in all study subjects, supports the hypothesis that babbling is necessary for speech and language development. Furthermore, the presence of babbling is universally evident regardless of the age at which speech develops. Finally, there is no demonstrable correlation between preoperative sign language and rate of speech development."qwqwLauren A.

La novedad en su planteamiento radica en que reconoce la inadecuacion de los limites politico-administrativos para la gestion y el ordenamiento de flujos ecologicos y socio-economicos muy diversos, y en este sentido supone un intento de aplicacion del enfoque de ecosistemas como herramienta de actuacion. Esta comunicacion se propone elucidar los elementos discursivos clave de la propuesta, encuadrandola en el marco de economia politica y del significado de la que, bajo nuestra perspectiva, forma parte. Dos son los ejes de este contexto: por una parte, la evolucion del capitalismo pos-industrial y las consecuencias culturales de las practicas de consumo de la naturaleza y la historia y la cultura como objetos fetiche; y por otra, las tendencias de desagrarizacion de las economias rurales, particularmente en el marco de relaciones entre UE /Marruecos."qwqwDavid Florido del Corral;Juan Clavero

Moreover, the nesting levels of these operators are closely related to the stratification of the arithmetical hierarchy. The same is shown for some further function operators known from computability and complexity theory. The close relationships between nesting levels of operators and the stratification of the hierarchy also hold for suitable restrictions of the operators with respect to the polynomial hierarchy if one starts with the polynomial-time computable functions. It follows that questions around P υs. NP and NP υs. coNP can equivalently be expressed by closure properties of function classes under these operators. The polytime version of the first value operator can be used to establish hierarchies between certain consecutive levels within the polynomial hierarchy of functions, which are related to generalizations of the Boolean hierarchies over the classes Σ p  k ."qwqwArmin Hemmerling,Ernst-Moritz-Arndt–Universität Greifswald, Institut für Mathematik und Informatik.

But few programs, if any, simultaneously address the problems of people who are both mentally ill and gay or lesbian. Typically a lesbian or gay person with significant mental illness has problems that affect social functioning, self-care, and self-direction. In addition, clients need help dealing with the external and internal stressors of being self-identified as gay men or lesbians. Literature on psychotherapy and social work with this particular population is scarce; therefore, it is no surprise that group models for gay and lesbian people who are severely emotionally disturbed are rare or nonexistent. Groups do exist outside of rehabilitative programs, but generally they are designed for reasonably well functioning clients. Many of these treatments tend to involve short-term, problem-focused approaches (Conlin & Smith, 1985) that usually deal with issues such as "coming out," or they might provide support for special subpopulations such as chemically dependent gay men, lesbian couples, or people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ongoing therapy groups are conducted in private practices and in community-based agencies, but these groups are often too threatening and alienating to more fragile and disturbed clients. Gay men and lesbians often must leave their rehabilitation program to find support for their sexual and social needs. In a more mainstream setting, such as a gay and lesbian community center, many chronically mentally ill clients report feeling awkward because of their mental health history and its related debilitating effects. If they seek counseling in a clinic that serves gay men and lesbians, they are often turned away because of their psychiatric diagnosis. In day treatment they experience the opposite problem, their psychiatric problems are recognized, but their needs related to being gay or lesbian are not. Psychological adjustment to being gay is sometimes difficult for even the most well adjusted individual. Being a member of two stigmatized minority groups can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and presentations. Because sexuality pervades one's mental life, gay and lesbian clients at conventional treatment programs need a special group that can address their psychosocial totality. This article describes a group model that has been tested at a psychiatric day clinic. The needs of clients are discussed in relation to their double stigmatization as mental patients and homosexuals. Strategies for overcoming resistance and homophobia within both the therapeutic community and the group are outlined. This material is drawn primarily from my experience conducting a "gay and lesbian issues" group at the Postgraduate Center's Social and Vocational Rehabilitation Clinic in New York City, a long-term after-care facility where the aim is rehabilitative treatment for people with severe chronic mental illness. Overcoming Institutional Resistance and Homophobia In addition to social stigmatization, gay and lesbian clients are still subject to the homophobia of mental health professionals and their agencies. Institutional denial of the specific needs of gay men and lesbians is often indirectly expressed by an administrator's resistance to the development of a gay- and lesbian-affirmative program. These professionals often argue that the clients could explore their issues in any of the "relationship," "dating," or "family" groups. To counteract this resistance it is necessary to explain to staff and administrators that the main purpose of the group is "homosocialization"--that is, friendships and alliances with other people like oneself (Isay, 1989). Smith (1988) briefly explored the unique concerns of homosexual clients who have psychotic or affective disorders. He suggested that peer socialization and the formation of a support network create a sense of belonging to a community that helps protect against decompensation during times of stress. …"qwqwSteven P.

Chewing performance was defined in terms of the reduction in food particle size after 15 chewing strokes. Data on chewing particle size and electromyographic activity were available for 24 asymptomatic adults from an earlier study. Jaw movements during chewing were recorded using electrognathography, and velocity and acceleration in three planes were determined. Power spectrum for acceleration was calculated during opening and closing phases of the chewing cycle. The frequency of the peak amplitude in the power spectrum represented physiologic tremor of the jaw. Tremor frequencies during both opening and closing phases of the chewing cycle were strong predictors of chewing performance. A multivariate model composed of variables derived from acceleration, together with electromyographic and jaw movement variables, produced a multivariate model that was able to predict chewing performance with an adjusted R2 value of .78."qwqwR.

Congruency (and incongruency) of a reach toward an object was a function of whether the object had just previously received positive or negative regard. Relative to congruent trials, both children and adults showed an increase in activation in the posterior STS bilaterally, in response to incongruent trials. In children, these STS regions exhibited developmental changes. Specifically, the differential response to Incongruent trials relative to Congruent trials was larger in older children in both hemispheres."qwqwBrent C.

All these articles have been peer reviewed by members of editorial board including guest editors. Here, I would personally like to take this opportunity to thank everyone on the editorial board who has volunteered his/her time to review the various articles that we have received and also the editorial staff at Bentham Science. Current Radiopharmaceuticals has caught the interest of many scientists working in Nuclear Medicine. The journal owes its success to all the authors who have submitted high quality manuscripts sharing in-depth knowledge in the area of radiopharmaceuticals to produce thematic issues. The idea behind thematic 'Hot Topic' issues is to generate maximum impact factor for the published material in that particular subject area of radiopharmaceuticals and nuclear medicine. A new feature for 2014 submission of manuscripts to the journal will include a graphical abstract to summarize the contents of the article in a concise pictorial form, which will enable rapid viewing of the journals' contents and help capture the readers' attention. The sixth volume of Current Radiopharmaceuticals contains articles on a wide range of hot topics. The efforts and determination of the editorial board and guest editors have helped promote the journal at various scientific meetings owing to its MEDLINE status since 2011. Our next goal is to earn soon an impact factor for the journal. In this 'mission', the help in diffusing our articles submitted by associate and guest editors, members of the editorial board, authors and interested readers will be of core importance. In this editorial review, I have summarized all the abstracts from 2013 issues 1 to 4. The first article of the year by Latli et al. is entitled as 'Sodium-Proton Exchanger Isoform-1: Synthesis of a Potent Inhibitor Labeled with Deuterium and Carbon-14', which gives an account of the synthesis of carbon-14 and deuterium labeled N-4-(1- acetyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-trifluoromethyl-benzoyl-guanidine, a potent sodium-proton exchanger NHE-1 inhibitor. These NHEs are plasma membrane proteins that are essential in the regulation of intracellular pH of the myocardium and the labeled NHE-1 inhibitors have been used to evaluate ADME studies. The next article 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 99mTc Chelate-conjugated Bevacizumab' by Camacho et al. discusses the role of the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab as a possible imaging agent against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in various animal models. The modified imaging agent 99mTc-HYNIC-bevacizumab was evaluated using the adenocarcinoma animal model. The authors concluded that this SPECT imaging agent has potential in tumor imaging at the preclinical level. In the following article on 'Biodistribution and Dosimetry of 177Lu-tetulomab, a New Radioimmunoconjugate for Treatment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma' by Repetto-Llamazares et al., the authors have evaluated the biodistribution of the following anti- CD37 radioimmunoconjugates177Lu-tetraxetan-tetulomab and 177Lu-tetraxetan-rituximab against free 177Lu. They used nude mice implanted with Daudi lymphoma xenografts and suggested that a higher tumor radiation dose can be reached using177Lutetraxetan- tetulomab in the clinic arena. In the article subjected as 'Novel 99mTc-labeled Diphosphonic Acid as Potential Bone Seeking Agent: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation' by Qiu et al., the authors have managed to prepare a novel zoledronate derivative, BIBDP labeled with 99mTc in high radiochemical purity with a good stability in vitro profile. This imaging agent showed a high specificity and efficacy in bone uptake compared to99mTc-MDP and 99mTc-ZL. The clear images were obtained after 1 h from using SPECT and this indicated that 99mTc- BIBDP has great potential for bone imaging. Subsequently, in the next article with the title 'Peptide Imaging with Somatostatin Analogs: More than Cancer Probes' by Cascini et al., the authors have studied the imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using the diagnostic tool Somastostatin (SS) scintigraphy (SRS). NETs and a number of non-neoplastic cells have been shown to possess a high affinity for binding between SS and its receptors (sstr). Numerous SS analogs have been studied and the pentetreotide labeled with In-111 has been described the one most widely used for imaging due to its high affinity towards sstr 2 and 5. The development of these SPECT imaging agents will enable the detection of NET and other disease processes. Furthermore, the article 'Bone Metastases Radiopharmaceuticals: An Overview' by Cuccurullo et al. reviews a number of radiolabeled compounds that are successfully used to detect and/or characterize bone metastases. This approach uses two radionuclide functional techniques scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Therefore, the diagnosis and evaluation of skeletal metastases require a combined approach of different diagnostic methods using the appropriate radiopharmaceutical. The last article in issue 1 is by Peter Mitrasinovic entitled as, 'Some Implications of Receptor Kinase Signaling Pathway for Development of Multi-targeted Kinase Inhibitors.' In this article, the author evaluates the various radiolabeled agents for PET and SPECT imaging against the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), especially towards the next generation of multitargeted kinase inhibitors. Issue 2 begins with the article on 'Radionuclide Antibody-Conjugates, a Targeted Therapy towards Cancer' by Kitson et al. In this article, they have evaluated the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptide conjugates and various chemical compounds to develop targeted therapies towards the treatment of oncological diseases. These TAT bio-vectors are able to transport a dose of alpha particles to destroy cancer cells. Radionuclide antibody-conjugates (RACs), labeled with beta emitters, have already been used in humans. The article concludes on the theory of tumor-antivascular- alpha-therapy (TAVAT) which may give rise to an alternative mechanism for TAT. This led to the article 'Generator Breakthrough and Radionuclidic Purification in Automated Synthesis of 68Ga-DOTANOC' by Belosi et al.; in this research, the authors have studied the efficacy of cationic pre-purification using commercial STRATAX- C, as well as distribution of the 68Ge contaminant during the synthesis of labeled peptides. The generator waste, STRATA-XC purification cartridge, synthesis waste and the final product were quantitatively analyzed by high resolution gamma ray spectrometry. They concluded that the synthesis using modular automated system produces 68Ga-DOTANOC, with limited user intervention. The 68Ge content in the final formulation was below 2x10-7% thus satisfying quality prerequisites for the radiopharmaceutical preparations. The next article is entitled as 'Comparing High LET 227Th- and Low LET 177Lu-trastuzumab in Mice with HER-2 Positive SKBR-3 Xenografts' by Abbas et al.; in this study, the authors set out to compare the biodistribution, normal tissue toxicity and therapeutic effect of the alpha-particle emitting 227Th-trastuzumab and the beta-particle emitting 177Lu-trastuzumab. These studies were carried out in mice with HER2- expressing SKBR-3 breast cancer xenografts. They concluded that thexenograft model gave a higher RBE for 227Th-trastuzumab compared to177Lu-trastuzumab, while the therapeutic index of 177Lutrastuzumab was superior to that of 227Th-trastuzumab. Then comes the article '131IIAZA as a Molecular Radiotherapeutic (MRT) Drug: Wash-Out with Cold IAZA Accelerates Clearance in a Murine Tumor Model' by Mercer et al.; here the authors have demonstrated in animal models that a wash out procedure using 131IIAZA as a Molecular Radiotherapeutic (MRT) drug could be utilized in the treatment of tumor hypoxia. The drawback to this approach was the high radioactivity level in the blood. Therefore to modulate the clearance of bound and free radioactive IAZA, non-radioactive (cold) IAZA was administered to the Balb/C EMT-6 murine tumor model. After 1 hour, an injection of high specific activity 125IIAZA was administered in the Balb/C EMT-6 murine tumor model. This 'wash out' procedure reduced the concentrations of radioactivity by at least 40% in all tissues especially in the kidney and liver, and least at the tumor site. Next is the article entitled as 'The Dilemma of Localizing Disease Relapse After Radical Treatment for Prostate Cancer: What is the Value of the Actual Imaging Techniques?' by Schiavina et al.; this paper seeks to evaluate the management of patients with BCR after radical treatment of prostate cancer from the urologist point of view. They concluded that Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging may have a role in the early phase of PSA relapse. Conventional imaging, such as bone scan and CT, is not suggested in the initial phase of BCR. Recently, it has been reported that PET/CT allows changes to the therapeutic strategy (from palliative to curative treatment and vice-versa) in about 20% of cases. In recent years, the new radiotracer 18F-FACBC has been proposed as a possible alternative radiopharmaceutical to detect prostate cancer relapse. In the article entitled as 'What is Currently the Best Radiopharmaceutical for the Hybrid PET/CT Detection of Recurrent Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma?' by Slavikova et al., the authors have voyaged to review literature evidence about the efficacy and tolerance of radiopharmaceuticals towards three targets of PET/CT imaging (glucose metabolism, bio-amines metabolism and somatostatin receptors).

This is of particular concern regarding magnesium alloy nanocomposites for wide ranging weight critical structural applications. In this study, various magnesium alloy nanocomposites containing Al2O3, carbon nanotube, TiC, or Si3N4 nanoparticle reinforcement were fabricated using solidification processing followed by hot extrusion. Here and for the first time, Nanoscale Electro Negative Interface Density (NENID) quantifies the nanoparticle–alloy matrix interfacial area per unit volume in the magnesium alloy nanocomposite taking into consideration the electronegativity of the nanoparticle reinforcement. We suggest that (1) NENID affects selected mechanical properties in magnesium alloy nanocomposites and (2) there are two joint mechanisms at nanoscale that enable tensile strength and ductility of the alloy nanocomposites to be simultaneously enhanced. We show that NENID indicates the possibility of relatively increased nanoparticle–alloy matrix interfacial reactions occurring while taking into account thermodynamic considerations."qwqwM.

To demonstrate this, they plotted the load vs. the penetration depth to the power 3/2. We show, through examples, the authors’ assertion is not credible because the methodology used is misleading and it cannot be asserted that the exponent 3/2 has a universal validity that applies to all kinds of materials.

This paper demonstrates that interesting lexical information can be gleaned from this corpus for EFL instructors and curriculum designers, even though the size of the corpus (61,000 words) makes it too small for dictionary development. The Corpus was organised to permit researchers to observe changes across age groups, and differences between the sexes and between children of different socio-economic backgrounds. Five investigations illustrate:• rate of vocabulary growth with age in this Corpus;• the extent to which vocabulary is sex-specific;• differences between sexes in the use of affirmatives and negatives, and in the use of male and female personal pronouns;• the extent to which vocabulary size is related to socio-economic class;• persistence of errors in applying regular verb endings to irregular verbs.The Corpus does show active vocabulary size increasing with age, at a rate of only around 50 words per year (in the limited activities used to elicit speech from the children). Surprisingly, around half of the words used by each of the sexes are limited to that sex. Boys make more use of positive expressions, whereas girls make greater use of negatives. Both sexes use he far more than she. There is no clear evidence that social class differences influence vocabulary size. Errors caused by applying regular verb endings to irregular verbs seem to diminish in children between ages six and eight, and have disappeared by age ten.Although it is clear that data sparsity influences these results, they are still useful (and thought-provoking) to curriculum developers and coursebook designers in EFL, as well as researchers in sociolinguistics of child language."qwqwClive Souter,University of Leeds

The authors use this review to launch their account of their own investigation into the attitudes towards inclusion of student teachers who had experience of working in special schools. Jackie Lambe and Robert Bones drew data from the transcripts of online discussions involving the student teachers. Using direct quotations from these discussions, the authors here reveal the positive attitudes that the student teachers developed towards practice in the special school settings; the confused or negative responses of the special school staff towards policy on inclusion; and mixed views on the promotion of enhanced collaboration between mainstream and special schools. Interestingly the student teachers, while continuing to value inclusion policy from a human rights perspective, also seemed to become more convinced, during their placements, of the contribution that specialist settings can make – and less confident that inclusion can be made to work effectively, given the current systems of teacher education and school organisation. The research in this article draws on the views of a small sample of student teachers – but the reported shifts in their perspectives illustrate some of the key issues to be confronted in the ongoing development of a more inclusive educational system."qwqwJackie Lambe;Robert Bones

Moreover, although "covenant" in 2:10 refers to Israel's covenant with God, which was being desecrated by intermarriage, we have rejected the view that "covenant" in vs. 14 refers to Israel's covenant in which the husband and the wife are considered to be fellow partners, rather than to the marital relation itself. We still need to consider this more fundamental and intriguing criticism of Isaksson's, namely his assertion that Malachi could not have considered literal marriage and divorce in terms of covenant concepts since such a view of marriage would be unprecedented and anachronistic within the post-exilic period.Keywords: divorce; idolatry; intermarriage; Isaksson; Israel's covenant; literal marriage; Malachi's condemnation; post-exilic period"qwqwGordon Paul Hugenberger

The suppression of this polarization was obtained by the redox L-lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction between L-lactate and NAD+. The addition of pyruvate inhibits the formation of NADH owing to the thermodynamically unfavorable (uphill) electron transfer from L-lactate to NAD+. The role played by the uphill/downhill character of the last step of the catalytic chain was illustrated by regenerating NADH using the redox couple gluconolactone/glucose with glucose dehydrogenase as catalyst. The influence on the catalytic wave of the presence of a downhill or uphill step between diaphorase and NAD+/NADH couple was also rationalized via the digital simulation technique using experimental data reported in the literature."qwqwRiccarda Antiochia,Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Metallorganica ed Analitica, Università di Padova, Via Marzolo 1, I‐35171 Padova, Italy;Albino Gallina,Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Metallorganica ed Analitica, Università di Padova, Via Marzolo 1, I‐35171 Padova, Italy;Irma Lavagnini,Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Metallorganica ed Analitica, Università di Padova, Via Marzolo 1, I‐35171 Padova, Italy;Franco Magno,Dipartimento di Chimica Inorganica, Metallorganica ed Analitica, Università di Padova, Via Marzolo 1, I‐35171 Padova, Italy

This was achieved by a combination of sensitive peptide mapping using microbore reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and automated microsequence analysis. Attempts to obtain N-terminal sequence data on P40 were unsuccessful due to N-terminal blockage of the native molecule. The nature of this N-terminal blocking was established using a combination of amino acid analysis, fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry and peptide synthesis. The P40 molecule, a single polypeptide chain comprising 126 amino acid residues, is structurally distinct from other known T-cell growth factors. No similarity was revealed when the amino acid sequence of P40 was compared with other proteins whose biochemical structure is known. The protein sequence data reported here predict four N-linked glycosylation sites in the P40 molecule."qwqwRichard J.

An analytical model which can describe the relationship between the bridging stress and the microstructure and a double cantilever beam (DCB) analysis which includes the bridging stress effect are developed in order to analyze the experimental results. The present model shows that the distribution of grain size as well as the average grain size are key microstructural factors that determine the bridging stress function. The results indicate that the shape of the bridging stress distribution is closely related to the grain size distribution. The effect of the bridging stress on the COD is taken into consideration in the DCB analysis. The crack closure due to bridging stress is calculated using the conventional power law relation and the new distributive bridging stress function developed in the present study."qwqwKee-Sun Sohn,Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea 790-784;Sunghak Lee,Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea 790-784;Sunggi Baik,Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea 790-784

The high magnetic field was found to accelerate spinodal decomposition in the early stage, but restrain the coarsening process, which led to the formation of very fine modulated structures with small aspect ratio for the ferromagnetic α 1  phase. The abnormal deterioration of magnetic properties was mainly attributed to the decrease of shape anisotropy of ferromagnetic α 1  phase for the step-aged Fe–25Cr–12Co–1Si alloy."qwqwX.Y.

The first and second constituents are provided in an alternating layered arrangement of respective first and second layers or are mixed together in a single layer. The nanoparticles have diameters smaller than wavelengths of light in the solar spectrum, to provide optical transparency for absorption of light.

In the identification module, a clustering algorithm is used to detect similar minutiae groups from multiple template images generated from the same finger and create the cluster core set. An algorithm compares the similarity level between the minutiae of the test fingerprint and the cluster core set and returns a likely list of candidates. In feedback module, we propose a path to learn and train the cluster core vector based on the assessment of cluster solution. The experiment results demonstrate that this similarity-searching approach proves suitable for one-too-many matching of fingerprints on large-scale databases. With the feedback module the proposed fingerprint identification scheme has inspiring identification performance."qwqwRen Qun,Inst. of Autom., Acad.

Design/methodology/approach – In this study, a case study methodology was used to explore CSR practices and the underlying motivations in two Portuguese companies. Findings – The results obtained suggest that some specificity may be present in the way of defining corporate responsibility for society by Portuguese companies. The Portuguese companies analysed seem to display an historical preference for corporate paternalism. This suggests that moral reasons can motivate firms (and individuals within them) to engage in social responsibility activities. Research limitations/implications – This work focuses on two specific case studies, but other cases might find diverse findings. Originality/value – It adds to the scarce research on CSR by Portuguese companie..."qwqwJoão F.

Whether there is a concomitant increase in contractility is controversial. Seventeen patients with chronic anemia (hematocrit range 17 to 30%) and 17 control subjects, matched by age and sex, were studied. In 10 patients and 10 control subjects (group I), a noninvasive evaluation of LV function through M-mode echocardiography and cuff blood pressure recording was performed. In patients with anemia, stroke volume increased 43% (p  −6  M. The observed increase in the developed tension persisted after β blockade, as well as the enhancement of the maximal rate of tension development. Plasma catecholamine levels in this group II were within the normal range. Thus, in anemia there is an enhancement of ejection phase indexes of LV performance and in vitro evidence suggesting the existence of a noncatecholamine factor that increases contractility."qwqwFlorenzano F;Gabriela Diaz;Carlos Regonesi;Escobar E

In the research described here, an attempt was made to look closely at the process these poor readers go through when trying to acquire new lexical information. Groups of poor readers were required to learn the pronunciations of a set of “irregular” nonsense words over a series of training sessions. There was an imperfect correspondence between the orthographic and phonological forms of these items, so grapheme-phoneme conversion rules could not be used (e. g., macht was pronounced “mot”). The results indicated that this learning task distinguishes between poor readers with a specific lexical deficit and those with a different type of reading difficulty. Ways in which this kind of task might usefully be employed in future research in this area are discussed."qwqwAnne Castles,University of Melbourne , ;V. M. Holmes,University of Melbourne ,

Postexercise proteinuria seems to be directly related to the intensity of exercise, rather than to its duration. The pattern of proteins identified in urine collected after exercise is different from normal physiological proteinuria. Immunochemical techniques demonstrate that postexercise proteinuria is of mixed glomerular-tubular type when heavy exercise is involved. The origin of proteinuria after light exercise seems to be preponderantly of glomerular type. Clearance of individual plasma proteins suggests an increased glomerular permeability and a partial tubular-reabsorption inhibition of macromolecules.(JAMA 1985;253:236-240)"qwqwJacques Poortmans

The thermodynamic analysis of the Zn2 +-NTA3--Cl--NH3-H2O and Pb2 +-NTA3--Cl--NH3-H2O systems demonstrated that the predominant zinc and lead species in the leaching solution were the ZnNTA(NH3)2- and PbNTA- complexes, respectively. The results of the leaching experiments indicated that more than 85% of Zn, 60% of Pb and less than 3% of Fe were leached from refractory hemimorphite using 2 mol/L NH3–2 mol/L NH4Cl–0.15 mol/L NTA as the leaching agent at 40 °C with a liquid-solid ratio of 10 mL/g. Moreover, a feasible method for zinc recovery and ligand regeneration was proposed: the ZnNTA(NH3)2- complex leaching solution was transformed into a zinc chloride solution through ammonia distillation and an acidity adjustment process. More than 96.0% of the NTA was recovered when the leaching solution pH was reduced to 1.0."qwqwShuai Rao,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;Duchao Zhang,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;Tianzu Yang,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;Hongbin Ling,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;Weifeng Liu,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;Lin Chen,School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China

The observed 14C-labeling patterns of Chl a are consistent with the presence of three kinetically important pools, the macrocycle, the phytol sidechain, and at least one precursor pool. The turnover rates of these pools were determined from a kinetic analysis of their labeling patterns. Turnover rates of Chl a or its two subunits were not significantly different from zero. The turnover rate of the precursor of the Chl a macrocycle was a constant multiple of the specific rate of pigment synthesis &,,,). An equation was derived that predicts pCh, a from the 14C labeling of Chl a. Rates of 14C incorporation into Chl a and rates of C fixation are severely unbalanced when algal cultures photoadapt. It is likely that pch, ~ as determined by the Chl-labeling method equals /*(-, the specific rate of carbon synthesis, only when growth is balanced. We demonstrated that the growth of natural phytoplankton populations can be severely unbalanced when the algae grow under a natural photocycle or when the algae are subjected to shifts in light intensity; we also observed that Chl a was synthesized in the dark. Thus, with the Chl-labeling method it is not possible to determine carbon-based growth rates when algae photoadapt or when the duration ofthe incubation covers only part ofthe diel light cycle. Chl-labeling experiments should therefore be based on 24-h incubations so that the measurements integrate over the diel photocycle. Carbon-specific rates of phytoplankton growth (pc, d-l) are easily measured in cultures, but until recently no direct method was available to measure pc in the field. Redalje and Laws (198 1) introduced the chlorophylllabeling method, which allows direct measurement of pc in the field: seawater is incubated with H14C03- as a tracer for periods ranging from 3 to 24 h. pc is determined from the amount of 14C that is found in Chl a at the end of the incubation period. Conceptually, the Chl-labeling method is simple: as algae grow in the light, inorganic C is assimilated and the"qwqwRalf Goericke,The Biological Laboratories, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02 148;Nicholas A.

metal","quantum theory","dft calculation","magnetic coupling"qwqwThe accurate description of spin-spin interactions in transition-metal cluster chemistry is a mandatory step to understanding and modelling the properties and reactivities of such systems. It cannot be achieved without a profound knowledge of the basic theory. Therefore, we provide in this review a survey from the most fundamental relativistic quantum chemical concepts and subsequent approximations towards conceptual problems such as the denition of local spins which does not emerge naturally from quantum theory. The concept of local spins plays a central role because it allows for a rigorous interpretation of the wave function in terms of magnetic coupling behavior of the interacting (metal) centers. In the last part of this review, we discuss the relevance and consequences of these concepts for transiton-metal chemistry and point to problems and pitfalls that may arise from state-of-the-art DFT calculations on transition-metal clusters."qwqwMaren Podewitz,Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland;Markus Reiher,Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland

Nosso estudo teve como objetivo determinar a presenca de imunoglobulinas G e M anti-T. gondii, e a frequencia de oocistos nas fezes de uma populacao de gatos domesticos do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Objetivou-se ainda estudar a associacao da infeccao por T. gondii com a idade, sexo, raca, estilo de vida, dieta e infeccao por retrovirus. Um total de 108 gatos foi incluido no estudo e 54 amostras de fezes foram obtidas desses animais. Somente 5,6% dos gatos foram sororreagentes para T. gondii, utilizando-se o teste de hemaglutinacao indireta. Nenhum dos 54 gatos apresentou oocistos em suas amostras fecais. Embora sem comprovacao estatistica, machos, sem raca definida, com acesso livre as ruas e gatos com mais de dois anos de idade tenderam a ser mais expostos ao parasito. Idade, estilo de vida e uso de caixa de areia foram considerados importantes fatores de risco. Anemia e infeccao por retrovirus nao apresentaram relacao com infeccao por T. gondii. Nao foram detectados anticorpos na maioria dos gatos (94,4%), indicando que esses gatos nunca foram expostos ao parasito e que, se infectados, poderao eliminar grande numero de oocistos no ambiente."qwqwBethânia Ferreira Bastos,Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil;Beatriz Brener,Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil;Liza Crissiuma Gershony,Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil;Liliane Maria Valentim Willi,Universidade Castelo Branco, Penha, Brazil;Norma Labarthe,Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Manguinhos, Brazil;Cássia Pereira,Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Manguinhos, Brazil;Flavya Mendes-de-Almeida,Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil

There are already several studies on FCCA in the literature, which focused on its population properties as well as consistency. Our setup most closely resembles that of   He et al. (2003)  . Under an assumption that controls the level of dependence (roughly that the dependence between the two functional objects is not too high), we derive convergence rates of the weight functions to their population counterpart. Both upper bound and lower bound are derived for the   L 2 -norm       L    2    -  norm        and the prediction risk (also called  Σ -norm) of the weight functions."qwqwHeng Lian,School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia

This resurgence of History represents one of the fundamental preoccupations of contemporary culture. The profound transformation of the ideological patrimony of XVIII century West Civilization seems to be proposed during our contemporary time again. A postmodern and actual reflection about cultural matrix of Enlightenment can avoid a schematic, poor and ideological reduction of a controversial and dramatic time such as Enlightenment."qwqwBiagio D'Angelo

As ferritin is a major source of iron in non-muscular organs and therefore a potential source of the iron required for oxygen radical chemistry, we have determined conditions under which ferritin iron reduction leads to the formation of a pool of iron which is capable of catalysing lipid peroxidation. Under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of rat liver microsomes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) catalysed the reduction of ferritin iron as shown by both continuous spectrophotometric measurements of tris ferrozine-Fe(II) complex formation and post-reaction Fe(II) determination. The presence of either ferrozine or citrate was not found to alter the time course or extent of ferritin reduction. In contrast, the addition of air to the reactants after a 20 min period of anaerobic reduction resulted in peroxidation of the microsome suspension (as d..."qwqwJ.Graham Goddard;Jonathan Gower;Colin J.

The original purposes of the investigation were, first, to find ways of eliminating the duplication inherent in the standard methods and, second, to adapt scribing techniques to compilation procedures. It developed, however, that these purposes could be accomplished simultaneously by the application of several unique techniques or methods which became apparent during the investigation and which are herein described. Combination Map Compilation - Color-Separation Methods not only are practical and time saving, but are eminently suited to quantity cartographic production. Training in these methods actually inspires more individual initiative on the job which, consequently, tends toward greater production. (Author)"qwqwMckeown

The low power quality signal is responsible for malfunctioning of equipments that result in reduction of production and rise in the cost of production. In the modern age electronic convertors, facts and other thyristor controlled devices is combine with the new power transmission schemes. That produces harmonics current of high frequency order and brings large amount of current and voltage quality distortion. In this paper we are investigating and implementing the Prony harmonics analysis algorithm for estimation of harmonics in the voltage cycle available during saturable core transformer energizing the result are validate and compared with the short time Fourier analysis our proposed approach found to be more accurate and aliquant for non linear discrete data signals. Many of the loads installed in present-day power systems are harmonic current generators. Combined with the impedance of the electrical system, the loads also produce harmonic voltages. The nonlinear loads may be viewed as both harmonic current generators and harmonic voltage generators. Until 1970s, speed control of AC motors was primarily achieved using belts and pulleys (9). Now, adjustable speed drives (ASDs) perform speed control functions very efficiently. ASDs are generators of large harmonic currents. Fluorescent lights uses less electrical energy for the same light output as incandescent lighting but produce substantial harmonic currents in the process. Due to increase of personal computer use it has resulted in harmonic current in commercial buildings. Harmonic distortion is no longer a phenomenon confined to industrial equipment and processes, where the first power quality concerns developed. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), personal computers (PCs), and electronic and entertaining devices proliferate nowadays in commercial and residential installations. These special kinds of loads represent formidable sources of harmonic currents and they increase with the expanding use of video recorders, digital clocks, and other sensitive electronic equipment."qwqwSandeep Wylie;Pratibha Tiwari

In alkaline solutions, the biomolecular rate constant of reaction between UO2-4 and e-aq was determined as k4=4.50×109M−1s−1. In acid solutions it has been observed that the analogous rate is within a range 1.7×1010<k9<7.4×1010M−1s−1 for the reaction between UO2+2 and e-aq. Analytical methods applied in this work were too fast to follow the slow disproportionation of produced U(V)-ion, but it has been observed that in alkaline solutions it probably goes via a dimeric ion U(V)2, which protonates with a rate k7=1.30 ×105s−1."qwqwRoman K.

The efficiency of readthrough in a psi+ lysate, mediated by exogenous suppressor tRNA, was significantly increased by polyamines as was the efficiency of endogenous UGA readthrough. The addition of polyamines, in the absence of exogenous suppressor tRNA, did not induce amber or ochre readthrough, nor could polyamines restore efficient termination readthrough in psi− lysates. It is concluded that polyamines interact with tRNA to increase the strength and specificity of the codon: anticodon interaction."qwqwMichael F.

The elastic demand coupled with a travel performance function is known to converge to a supply-demand equilibrium, where a stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) is obtained. SUE is the state in which all equivalent path costs are equal, and thus no user can reduce his perceived travel cost. The elastic demand SUE traffic assignment can be formulated based on a dynamic system, which is a means of describing how one state develops into another state over the course of time. Traditionally it has been used for control engineering, but it is also useful for transportation problems in that it can describe time-variant traffic movements. Through the Lyapunov Function Theorem, the author proves that the model has a stable solution and confirms it with a numerical example."qwqwYong-Taek Im

Se encontro un efecto significativo en tres de los cinco factores de violencia en las aulas, senalados por Prieto (2005): fracaso escolar, clima negativo y medios audiovisuales. Y  no se encontro, ni el grupo de amigos, ni el entorno familiar. Se plantea una intervencion desde un programa tutorial a traves de aprendizaje cooperativo, dinamicas de grupo, y estrategias de solucion de conflictos. Se especifican objetivos y actividades  aplicadas en 6 sesiones, durante cuatro meses, en las clases destinadas a tutorias. La intervencion causo un impacto significativo en el grupo experimental  mas que en el grupo control en las actitudes contrarias a la violencia y la discriminacion. Sin embargo, no aprecio efecto significativo sobre el clima escolar. El programa de intervencion tendria un mayor peso conductual, con mas sesiones de intervencion,  durante dos o mas cursos, con la participacion de las familias, de mas profesores y con una intervencion en el ocio. Se concluye que con una accion tutorial breve, basada en una evaluacion de los procesos de interaccion, se ha conseguido un cambio de actitudes basico mara mejorar un clima escolar conflictivo."qwqwMaría del Carmen Carpio de los Pinos;Victoriana García Díaz

Using data from a survey conducted among South Carolina residents following Hurricane Floyd in 1999 as the basic information, dynamic information regarding the storm, the network, the destination zones, and decisions made by the emergency managers regarding the issuing of evacuation notices was added to the sample to provide a database that contained time-dependent data in 48 2-h time periods preceding landfall. Separate models were established for evacuees seeking shelter at the homes of friends and relatives and those who went to hotels and motels. The models describe destination choice in terms of time-dependent travel time between origin and destination, the amount of accommodation remaining in each zone in each time period, the estimated likelihood that the storm’s path takes it over a destination zone, the ethnic similarity between origin and destination zones, and the presence of a large metropolitan area and/or interstate highways in a destination zone. When estimating the performance of the models, their trip length frequency distributions are not significantly different to the observed trip length frequency distribution at the 95% level of significance. Applying the friend/relative model to the neighboring state of Georgia produced a trip length frequency diagram that had a similar pattern to the observed distribution but underestimated short-distance destinations and overestimated distant destinations."qwqwGuangxiang Cheng;Chester G Wilmot;Earl J.

Methods : cDNA probe 289 base pairs for swine HEV were generated by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. In situ hybridization with a nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe was used for the detection of swine HEV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.   Results : When liver tissues from the pigs naturally infected with swine HEV were hybridized with the nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe, a strong signal was seen in hepatocytes and bile duct. Positive hybridization signals were also detected in small and large intestine, lymph node, tonsil, spleen, and kidney.   Conclusions : Swine HEV was detected primarily in the hepatocytes. Swine HEV may also replicate in tissues other than the liver. In situ hybridization described in the present study has greatly facilitated the application of in situ hybridization procedures to the clinical setting, thus allowing for the diagnosis of swine HEV infection while preserving the morphology of the tissue."qwqwChangsun Choi,Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, San 56-1, Shillim-Dong, Kwanak-Gu, Seoul 51-742, South Korea;Chanhee Chae,Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, San 56-1, Shillim-Dong, Kwanak-Gu, Seoul 51-742, South Korea

From its' earliest inceptions, systems engineering dealt with providing a solution that balanced performance and operational requirements at the lowest life cycle cost. As an art form, systems' engineering was based upon the methods and processes of individuals. As the tools, methodologies and philosophies of systems engineering evolved, it was transformed from an art to a science. This transformation is demonstrated in evolution that occurred through IEEE 1220, EIA 632, and EIA 731.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#While many of the attributes of these guidance documents map in to understood design areas such as hardware, software, and ease of manufacture, they do not clearly map into areas such as support strategy, impact to total ownership cost, maintenance planning and technology refresh cycles. These later actions fall under the discipline of supportability engineering. The systems engineering model contains numerous opportunities for supportability linkage, however the supportability hand-offs were undefined when the systems engineering standards were released. This is because systems engineering guidance documents were being written at the same time supportability engineering was evolving to a standalone entity. The result is the documents have a strong interface, but without the necessary details to effectively integrate the disciplines.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper describes the interconnections and key linkages that need to be addressed to flow information between supportability engineering and systems engineering, and the further evolution of the systems engineering process through assimilation of supportability engineering."qwqwMichele Hanna,Lockheed Martin Navel Electronics and Surveillance Systems (NESS) Moorestown NJ

This observation has been made possible by the use of an S1 nuclease assay that is both sensitive and quantitative. In order to detect rRNA synthesis from the injected template above the large background of rRNA endogenously present in oocytes, the divergence of ribosomal DNA sequences between two Xenopus species was utilized. Cloned X. laevis ribosomal DNA was injected into the nuclei of X. borealis oocytes. Total oocyte RNA was then isolated and hybridized to a radioactive DNA probe that over laps the 5' end of X. laevis rRNA; endogenous rRNA of the X. borealis oocytes does not hybridize to the probe. RNA/DNA hybrids were treated with S1 nuclease and protected fragments were sized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA made from the injected rDNA protects the same region of probe as does authentic X. laevis precursor rRNA. Thus, transcription appears to initiate on the cloned, microinjected X. laevis rDNA at the same site as is used in vivo. This synthesis is not impaired by coinjection of an amount of alpha-amanitin sufficient to inhibit RNA polymerase II and III; therefore the reaction is mediated by RNA polymerase I. The amount of transcription may be reproducibly quantitated and we have varied a number of parameters in order to maximize transcriptional expression of the injected rDNA. Eight independently isolated X. laevis rDNA clones as well as several subcloned initiation regions of these genes are all accurately transcribed at approximately equal efficiency. This assay should facilitate analysis of several aspects of rRNA transcription, including deleniation of the Xenopus RNA polymerase I promoter location."qwqwBarbara Sollner,Department of Physiological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University725 N.

A massificacao das tecnologias computacionais para os mais variados contextos de uso tem levado as empresas de tecnologia da informacao a procurarem formas de entender melhor seus consumidores. Nesse contexto, as pesquisas em UX ganham espaco no intuito de buscar atingir os objetivos dos produtos e servicos relacionados ao objeto de estudo.#R##N#Com base na realizacao de uma pesquisa exploratoria, este estudo teve como objetivo entender quais praticas alguns profissionais situados no estado da California, Estados Unidos, tem utilizado para melhor conhecer as experiencias proporcionadas aos usuarios atraves de seus produtos. Esse entendimento passou por uma comparacao das praticas encontradas nas propostas oferecidas por Garret (2002) e Maguire (2001): a identificacao de como o resultado dessas praticas sao aplicadas no processo de projeto; se elas sao conduzidas de forma interna ou externa; e qual o posicionamento dos designers perante a sua aplicacao. Na pesquisa exploratoria foram realizadas entrevistas com profissionais atuantes em empresas de tecnologia da informacao. Alem disso, tambem se buscou fazer uma revisao bibliografica nas areas de design para experiencia, design centrado no usuario, design centrado no produto e design centrado na interacao, com o objetivo de coletar insumos teoricos para esta pesquisa. O estudo relevou uma certa variedade de abordagens e perspectivas sobre a conducao de pesquisas relacionadas a UX, muitas delas com inspiracao em outras areas do conhecimento que nao o design. Tambem se verificou uma tentativa dos profissionais da area seguirem um processo de projeto mais leve, executando as pesquisas de forma mais frequente e com um menor grau de preocupacao quanto a selecao dos candidatos, o que levantou serias preocupacoes quanto a sua validade.  Ainda foi possivel identificar que um melhor entendimento da area se faz necessario, por isso este trabalho buscou apontar possiveis caminhos pelos quais os novos estudos possam vir a contribuir para as discussoes sobre pesquisas relacionadas ao design, as quais tenham o usuario como preocupacao central e suas respectivas aplicacoes ao processo de projeto."qwqwAlisson Douglas da Silveira Pacheco

This approach is based on a fully coupled hydro-mechanical analysis and an extended finite element method (XFEM) to represent discrete fractures. Convergence tests indicate that the proposed scheme is both consistent and stable. The contributions of this paper include: (1) a new junction enrichment to describe intersecting fractures in deformable porous media; (2) the treatment of sealed fractures. We employ the resulting discretization scheme to perform numerical experiments, to illustrate that the inclination angles of the fractures and the penetration ratio of the sealed fractures are two key parameters governing the flow within the fractured porous medium."qwqwMao Sheng,State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China;Gensheng Li,State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China;Subhash N.

The theory treats off-diagonal disorder and is thus suitable for application to systems with disordered force constants. An example of such a system, to which particular consideration is given, is NH 4 Cl, which has a disordered phase in which the force constants between NH 4  +  ions are disordered because there are two equally probable orientations of an NH 4  +  ion within a unit cell. The effect of disorder, in particular the breakdown of k-conservation, on the optical properties of such systems is studied via a calculation of the single-particle Green's function. Both the optical absorption and Raman cross section are shown to be related to the self-energy of this Green's function, and expressions for these quantities are obtained which are exact to second order in the ratio of order-dependent to non order-dependent force constants. The major qualitative features of the expression for the Raman cross section are found to be in good agreement with existing Raman scattering data on NH 4 Cl."qwqwJuan Loveluck;J.B. Sokoloff

The letters to the editor we subsequently received deliver two messages: first, that this review series will serve a real need, and second, that we must be thorough in our treatment of each product. We didn't intend the introductory article to be an in-depth account in any sense. Instead, we tried to set a context for the future reviews by relating certain background information--histories and design principles--and a brief overview of current uses for each of the three productivity packages.At the time, we had more such information about Mathematica and Maple than for Matlab. Subsequently, Matlab's inventor, Cleve Moler, authored an article that addressed much of the points we were missing. In view of this information's emergence, and in response to the feedback we've received, we felt we should include some selections from Moler's article in this installment."qwqwNorman Chonacky,Yale University;David Winch

The compositions comprise retinol, a volatile silicone and a mutual solvent for the retinol and silicone. Preferred compositions contain retinol, cyclomethicone and ethanol. Were the retinol level in the compositions is between 0.005 and 1.0 weight percent, the compositions may be topically applied to the skin in areas where fine lines, wrinkles or other signs of aging exist. Such topical application results in a reduction in wrinkles and fine lines and improves skin quality.

Presently agriculture uses only the plant cell contents (e.g., oils, proteins, starch and sugars) whilst forest based industries used only the fibres and discard the rest. An alternative approach outlined by D.E. Weiss is to separate the green plant material into two major fractions (fibres and contents) before their processing into fibre and food products. The concept embodied in this approach, called integrated photosynthetic product industries (IPPI), is illustrated in a generalized fractionaction crop scheme. In this paper the author looks at the pathway taken by the fibre-rich fraction in the IPPI scheme, and in particular at new technologies developed for growing and harvesting the cellulose crops, for separating the fibres, and for converting them into consumer products. The term ''cellulosic'' is used to describe the fibres rather than the term ''cellulose'' to emphasize that whole separated plant fibres are being considered rather than fibres which have been pulped to remove the non-cellulosic material. Such cellulosic fibres, then, may contain in addition to cellulose some of the lignin and non-cellulosic polysaccharides with which it is naturally associated in plant cell walls. These materialsmore » modify the fibre properties and their retention with the cellulose in the fibres makes for greater yields at lower cost since their removal is expensive. Thus on an oven-dry basis the pure cellulose content of wood is usually in the range 40 to 50% whereas the yield on the same basis of cellulosic fibres can be in excess of 80%. 40 references.« less"qwqwA.J.

To define doses which effectively suppress reproductive function in NZB/W mice, we implanted groups of NZB/W females with Silastic capsules containing increasing doses of four compounds: norethindrone (NE) 0.5-5.0 mg, norgestrel (NG) 1.0–7.5 mg, medroxyprogesterone (MP) 0.5–20.0 mg, and ethinyl estradiol (EE) 0.5-5.0 mg. Controls received empty implants. Serum concentrations of LH and FSH, uterine weight, endometrial proliferation, and luteal tissue were assessed after 3 weeks of treatment. Based upon these parameters, we determined that effective doses were 5.0 mg NE, 7.5 mg NG, and 0.5 mg EE given as single implants and 10.0 mg MP given in two 5.0-mg implants. This is the first dosing study of contraceptive steroids in a murine model of lupus. Effective, nontoxic doses of these drugs can now be employed in studies of interactions between gonadal hormones and autoimmunity."qwqwLydia W.

The full data set (1930–1994) is interpreted by both a standard virtual population analysis (VPA) and a version that allows for cannibalism. The resulting extended time-series of population abundanceat-age is used to reconsider the parent stock, temperature, and predation relationships described earlier. Results from the version of the VPA with cannibalism based on the new data confirm the earlier findings that temperature and spawning-stock biomass had a significant positive effect on recruitment. This is not the case with the extended time-series as interpreted by the standard VPA because, while significant temperature and juvenile predation effects are still found, a parent stock effect is no longer statistically significant. Moreover, the general level of explanation provided by the multiple regression is far less with the extended time-series."qwqwJohn W. Pope;Philip A. Large;Tore Jakobsen

In one embodiment, the pumping system includes a subsurface pump, a tubing string, and a surface pumping unit. The subsurface pump is anchored downhole and driven by repeated upward and downward motion of the tubing string. The subsurface pump pumps fluids to the surface via the tubing string. The upward and downward motion of the tubing string is imparted by any suitable surface pumping unit such as, e.g. a beam pumping unit or a hydraulic pumping unit. This pumping system advantageously provides for a minimal number of strings downhole, requiring at most only (1) casing and (2) the production tubing. Accordingly, the well may be drilled using a very slender hole, thereby allowing for sharply reduced drilling and production costs."qwqwHumberto F. Leniek

A D2 receptor has recently been cloned (Bunzow, J. R., Van Tol, H. H. M., Grandy, D. K., Albert, P., Salon, J., Christie, M. D., Machida, C. A., Neve, K. A., and Civelli, O. (1988) Nature 336, 783-787) and expressed in two different cell lines, pituitary GH4C1 cells and Ltk- fibroblasts, where it has been shown to induce inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have investigated the additional effector systems coupled to this receptor. The responses observed in the two cells lines, which express similar levels of receptors (0.5-1 x 10(5)/cell), were surprisingly different. In GH4C1 cells D2 receptors failed to affect phosphoinositide hydrolysis and induced a decrease of Ca2+i. This latter effect appears to be mediated by hyperpolarization, most likely due to the activation of K+ channels. In striking contrast, in Ltk- fibroblasts the D2 receptor induced a rapid stimulation of inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (+73% at 15 s) followed by the other inositol phosphates, and an immediate increase of Ca2+i due to both Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores and influx from the extracellular medium. In both GH4C1 and Ltk- cells, the D2 receptor response was mediated by G protein(s) sensitive to pertussis toxin. The increases of inositol trisphosphate and Ca2+i observed in Ltk- cells required dopamine concentrations only slightly higher than those inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (EG50 = 25, 29, and 11 nM, respectively) and were comparable in magnitude to the responses induced by the endogenous stimulatory receptor agonists, thrombin and ATP. The results demonstrate that in certain cells D2 receptors are efficiently coupled to the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The nature of receptor responses appears therefore to depend on the specific properties not only of the receptor molecule but also of the cell type in which it is expressed."qwqwLucia Vallar,University of Milan;Claudia Muca,University of Milan;Michele Magni,University of Milan;Paul R.

El lector de esta obra se encontrara con riguroso trabajo sobre algunos de los temas mas sensibles del derecho actual de la region, como lo son: la institucion de los tribunales constitucionales y el control constitucional, el debido proceso sustantivo en America, las acciones constitucionales y las de proteccion de los derechos humanos, la prueba en los procesos constitucionales y los muy tecnicos asuntos de la imprevision constitucional y la manipulacion constitucional. Temas recientes y actuales para un espacio juridico que, como el latinoamericano, se debate en el dilema de continuar con la tradicion formalista que en el pasado dio lugar a soluciones politicamente autoritarias o de la posibilidad de abrirse a las corrientes de la garantia y proteccion de los derechos en la nueva comprension del derecho procesal, lejos de situarse en la mera conformidad de los tramites. Es un espacio que se asume y se ejerce como verdadero derecho a la justicia, en una region historicamente marcada por desigualdades e injusticias de todo tipo."qwqwGabriel-Angel Hernández-Villarreal

These language models, developed from constraint dependency grammar parses, tightly integrate knowledge of words, morphological and lexical features, and syntactic dependency constraints. Two structured language models are applied for N-best rescoring, one is an almost-parsing language model, and the other utilizes more syntactic features by explicitly modeling syntactic dependencies between words. We also investigate effective and efficient language modeling methods to use N-grams extracted from up to 1 teraword of web documents. We apply all these language models for N-best re-ranking on the NIST and DARPA GALE program 1  2006 and 2007 machine translation evaluation tasks and find that the combination of these language models increases the BLEU score up to 1.6% absolutely on blind test sets."qwqwWen Wang,SRI Int., Menlo Park;Andreas Stolcke,SRI Int., Menlo Park;Jing Zheng,SRI Int., Menlo Park

Our 5-year bio-monitoring study of the Bronx River Estuary demonstrates comparatively low dissolved oxygen concentrations in this urbanized watershed. Additionally, our current results establish altered hormonal levels, resulting from endocrine disruption, in  Geukensia demissa  (Atlantic ribbed mussel) from the Bronx River Estuary. No studies have yet investigated a correlation between low dissolved oxygen and endocrine disruption in field-collected bivalves. Testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone levels were collected from male and female mussels in the oxygen depleted Bronx River and well-oxygenated Greenwich Cove. Bronx River mussels exhibited higher testosterone levels and lower estradiol levels than Greenwich Cove mussels. The resulting abnormal hormonal ratio seems to indicate that environmental conditions in the Bronx River facilitate an allosteric inhibition of the cytochrome P450 aromatase enzyme, which aids conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Low progesterone levels suggest that Bronx River mussels are experiencing a delay in sexual maturation, and morphometric data show a stalling of shell and tissue growth. To confirm that the mussels collected from both sites are the same species, the universal mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene was analyzed, through DNA barcoding. Minimal sequential heterogeneity confirmed the mussels are the same species. Such findings suggest intraspecific divergence in various endocrine processes, resulting from environmentally induced stress."qwqwZachery M.

This study set out to describe the decline in Puffin numbers on Lundy and conduct an initial investigation into the factors mediating colony attendance and breeding site selection. Counts took place at St. Philip’s Stone over 19 days from 2 July to 4 August 2008. Wind speed (knots), rainfall (mm), air temperature (oC), mean numbers of Herring Gulls and time of day were analysed as predictors of the mean number of Puffins in a stepwise regression. Attendance was significantly higher in the evening than at midday, but numbers were not significantly higher in the morning compared to numbers at midday. A novel finding showed that attendance decreased as temperature increased. Effects of wind speed and rainfall approached significance, and gull numbers had no effect on attendance, but observations suggest that Puffins benefited from their presence. In a within-site analysis of St. Philip’s Stone, non-parametric tests indicated pairs which bred successfully were located close to a cliff edge and in areas occupied by other auks. In a between-site analysis of the site register data, presence of Puffins was more likely when Guillemots and Razorbills occupied the area. Puffins were mainly present on the west side of the island. This study signifies that ecological variables influence Puffin breeding site selection and attendance, but future work is needed for increased reliability."qwqwClaire B Let-C Haraudeau;Kate M Arshall;Lisa Leaver

A qualitative feminist psychological perspective is adopted, which shifts the emphasis from models of individual deficiency to a model of subjective meanings shaped in relation to social and historical discourses surrounding femininity, sexual attractiveness and a `thin ideal' of body size. The life span perspective reduces the emphasis on young women, and explores sexual attractiveness and relationships in relation to ageing discourses which construct women's sexual attractiveness as declining after early adulthood. In addition, the contribution of women's experiences of feeding their families to the meanings of body size and food are explored. The research is located within the tradition of symbolic interactionism (Mead, 1934; Blumer, 1969). It develops a methodology incorporating social constructionist grounded theory (Henwood and Pidgeon, 1995; Charmaz, 1990) and feminist standpoint methodology (Griffin, 1995; Oakley, 1981). The individual is conceptualised as constructing the meanings of her experiences in relation to extra-local discourses through a process of interaction with, and reflection upon, discourses. The empirical research comprised a pilot study (N=3), which used a group interview methodology to explore the experiences of three women in their early twenties. The main studies of the thesis used in-depth individual interviews to explore the meanings of body size and food for women aged between sixteen and eighteen (Study One, N=15); women in the thirty to forty five age group (Study Two, N=18); and women in the over sixty age group (Study Three, N=12). The findings of the thesis indicate that there were a range of different meanings surrounding body size and food for women from the different age groups of the studies. These meanings were related to the different sexual and family relationships in which the women were involved and to the women's sense of themselves in these relationships. The women's experiences of the relationship between self and others were constructed in relation to the social discourses surrounding femininity and women's roles, where there was a reflection upon these discourses in the context of the women's lives and experiences. In addition, some women also constructed their experiences in relation to alternative discourses which minimised the importance of body size and rejected the traditional expectations of women's lives and relationships."qwqwJr Tunaley

Here main emphasize is given to distinguish between an edge pixel and a noisy pixel. The proposed method is, basically, a three step method, where in the first step; the suspected pixels are detected based on their differences from neighboring pixels. In the next step, suspected pixels are categorized by edge pixels or noisy pixels. Then the noisy pixels are only replaced by median of uncorrupted pixels of the considering window. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, results are compared with other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Results of the proposed method are found to be encouraging."qwqwAnkit Kumar,Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Meghalaya;A.

With increasing undercooling of the liquid Cu below the melting point, self-diffusion slows down along with an increase in the structural relaxation time as compared with the normal liquid state. A massive structural rearrangement leading to incipient nucleation for crystallization occurs at a certain supercooling and time, underlying the existence of a transition in dynamical heterogeneities. Based on the temperature dependence of the characteristic relaxation times, a time-temperature-nucleation diagram has been constructed by which the relaxation, nucleation, and glass transition can be consistently correlated."qwqwHao Pang,Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, People’s Republic of China;Z.

Crude aqueous extract of E. jambolana was subjected to purification using chromatographic techniques which yielded purified active compound (FIIc). Purity of FIIc was tested by HPLC. Phytochemical investigation of FIIc by NMR, IR, and UV spectra showed that the purified compound is α-hydroxy succinamic acid. The streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats were fed atherosclerotic (Ath) diet containing 1.5 mL olive oil containing 8 mg (3, 20,000 IU) vitamin D2 and 40 mg cholesterol for 5 consecutive days. The STZ-induced diabetic rats receiving Ath diet were orally administered FIIc at doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, and results were compared with reference drug, that is, glibenclamide (600 μg/mg) and healthy control. 30-day treatment with FIIc resulted in significant (Pl.001) improvement in blood glucose, serum lipid profile, apolipoproteins (Apo A1 and apoB100), and endothelial dysfunction parameters.

In this paper, to reduce the intensity non-uniformity influence, a pixel gray value correction method based on illuminance and irradiance theory is proposed. The irradiance relation between the object point on-axis and the object point off-axis is analyzed, and a compensation formula is deduced to correct the image intensity.

The buffer plate (300) is aligned such that an opening (302) therein overlaps each display area, and such that a lattice member (301) thereof overlaps the region where the seal material is disposed. The panel body (110) is pressed and heated from outside through the buffer plate (300), thereby heating and curing the thermosetting seal material.

They function in chromosome condensation and segregation and in DNA repair. Using an insertion vector containing the pac gene for resistance to puromycin, we have created an insertion in the smc gene of Methanococcus voltae. We used epifluorescence microscopy to examine the cell and nucleoid morphology, DNA content and metabolic activity. This insertion causes gross defects in chromosome segregation and cell morphology. Approximately 20% of mutant cells contain little or no DNA, and a subset of cells (≈ 2%) IS abnormally large (three to four times their normal diameter) titan cells. We believe that these titan cells indicate cell division arrest at a cell cycle checkpoint. The results confirm that SMC in archaea is an important player in chromosome dynamics (as it is in bacteria and eukaryotes)."qwqwDavid M. FaguyCorresponding authorE-mail dfaguy@unm.edu

Nilai-nilai yang menjadi parameter suatu sistem pelayanan (antrian) dapat menggambarkan kondisi pelayanan atau sistem antrian yang ada.#R##N#Unit Rawat Jalan Rumah Sakit Telogorejo Semarang yang dipandang sebagai suatu sistem pelayanan kesehatan, mempunyai serangkaian urutan pelayanan yang harus dilalui pasien. Dengan banyaknya fasilitas pelayanan yang ditawarkan oleh pihak rumah sakit dan pengaruh kedatangan pasien yang tidak dapat diperkirakan, ternyata banyak fasilitas pelayanan yang berada pada kondisi idle. Tetapi juga terdapat fasilitas pelayanan yang sering mengakibatkan antrian pasien yang panjang. Ketidakefisienan suatu fasilitas pelayanan dapat dieliminer dan diubah menjadi suatu kondisi yang optimal.#R##N#Simulasi merupakan bentuk representasi dari suatu sistem nyata yang berjalan pada rentang waktu tertentu. Pada penelitian ini simulasi digunakan untuk merepresentasikan sistem antrian. Pada sistem antrian digunakan tiga parameter yaitu rata-rata panjang antrian, rata-rata waktu tunggu dan utilisasi. Ketiga parameter tersebut akan diprioritaskan sesuai dengan kondisi sistem yang ada. Ketiga parameter ini digunakan untuk mendapatkan suatu model alternatif yang akan dirancang. Model alternatif yang telah dirancang kemudian akan diterjemahkan ke dalam pemrograman simulasi. Teknik simulasi yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini Adalah simulasi komputer dengan menggunakan Extend V.4.#R##N##R##N#Kata Kunci : simulasi, sistem antrian, rata-rata panjang antrian, rata-rata waktu tunggu, utilisasi."qwqwBambang Purwanggono;Zainal Fanani;Ary Arvianto

The basic-state distorted polar night jets are obtained from a numerical simulation of the sudden warming in a nonlinear spectral model. The instability is studied at days 10 (Flow I) and 15 (Flow II), prior to the onset of the model sudden warming, in addition, a parameter study is carried out in which the basic state zonal flow, static stability, wave amplitude, Rayleigh friction and Newtonian cooling are changed. It is found that the zonally averaged jets are stable in the presence of Rayleigh friction and Newtonian cooling. However, the three-dimensional distorted flows are unstable and the fastest growing modes have growth rates between 0.0664 and 0.144 day−1 (doubling times between 10.44 and 4.80 days). In the presence of damping, the disturbance streamfunctions for Flows I and II have largest amplit..."qwqwJorgen S. Frederiksen

However, these tags are often not related to the actual image content, affecting the performance of tag related applications. In this paper, a novel approach to automatically refine the image tags is proposed. Firstly, information entropy of the tag is defined to refine tag frequency to predict tag initial relevance. Then, tag correlation is calculated from two sides. One side is to measure semantic similarity of tag pairs using the structured information of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia. The other one is to compute the visual similarity of tag pairs based on the visual representation of the tag. Finally, to re-rank the original tags, a fast random walk with restart is used and the top ones are reserved as the final tags. Experimental results conducted on dataset NUS-WIDE demonstrate the promising effectiveness of our approach."qwqwWengang Cheng,School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China;Xiaolei Wang,School of Control and Computer Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China

The objectives of this study were to investigate the co-disposal of dewatered sewage sludge and municipal solid waste withrespect to their consolidation characteristics, vane shear strength, and leachability. The results of the consolidation tests show that, for a given stress increment, the deformation (the change in the void ratio) of the dewatered sewage sludge is larger than the deformation of its sludge mixtures. When the sludge ratio in the mixture increases, the compressibility of the mixture increases. The total consolidation settlement taking place in landfilling of dewatered sewage sludge alone would be much greater than that for co-disposal of sludge with solid waste.

The opportunity, both optical, and electric frequency control of generation, is shown. The expansion of a tuning frequency range of generation of self-excited oscillators of superhigh frequencies is one of major problems at their design. One of paths of the decision of this problem is the variation of equivalent capacity of a tuning circuit of UHF of the oscillator and dynamic negative resistance canceling power losses in the tuning circuit. The variation of these parameters is possible through action of optical radiation on a photosensitive diode switched on in a circuit of backward positive communication of the self-excited oscillator. On Fig. 1 the circuit of the self-excited oscillator is represented. It represents a hybrid integrated circuit consisting of three bipolar transistors, three resistors, capacity, inductance and photosensitive diode. Such circuit implements the self-excited oscillator of superhigh frequencies with optical frequency control of generation. The tuning circuit consists of inductance L1 and equivalent capacity of a complete resistance existing on electrodes of a collector and the emitter of the bipolar transistor VT2. The variation of power of optical radiation from 0 up to 120 uWt/cm2 reduces in a frequency change of generation on 70 MHz at supply voltage of 5 V.

The distribution of  F. hepatica  in sheep in Europe is usually scattered and studies are generally concerned with a single area making it difficult to compare results from different environments, climates and management regimes. In order to elucidate the current scenario in terms of prevalence and intensity of  F. hepatica  infection in sheep farms across Europe, a standardized cross-sectional survey was conducted in three pilot areas in Ireland, Switzerland and Italy, all part of the EU funded GLOWORM project. Two consecutive field surveys (in 2012 and 2013) were conducted in the three countries in the same period (August-October) in 361 sheep farms in total. Harmonized procedures (from farm to laboratory) based on pooled samples and the highly sensitive and accurate, diagnostic FLOTAC technique were used. The georeferenced parasitological results were modelled (at the pilot area level) following a Bayesian geostatistical approach with correction for preferential sampling and accounting for climatic and environmental covariates. The observed  F. hepatica  prevalence rates did not differ between the two study years in any of the three pilot areas, but they did vary between the countries showing high values in Ireland (61.6%) compared to Italy (7.9%) and Switzerland (4.0%). Spatial patterns of  F. hepatica  distribution were detected by the Bayesian geostatistical approach in Ireland with a high risk of infection in the south-western part of the pilot area there. The latent factor analysis highlighted the importance of year-to-year variation of mean temperature, rainfall and seasonality within a country, while long-term trends of temperature and rainfall dominated between countries with respect to prevalence of infection."qwqwLaura Rinaldi,Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples Federico II, Naples;#R##N#CREMOPAR Campania Region, Naples;Annibale Biggeri,Department of Statistics, Informatics and Applications “G.#R##N#Parenti”, University of Florence;Vincenzo Musella,Department of Health Sciences, University “Magna Græcia”#R##N#of Catanzaro, Catanzaro;Theo de Waal,UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin;Hubertus Hertzberg,Institute of Parasitology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich;Fabien Mavrot,Section of#R##N#Epidemiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich;Paul R.

Shortly following the commitment to sporulation, B. subtilis divides asymmetrically, dividing the cell into two compartments, a smaller forespore (the future spore) and a larger mother cell. Subsequently, in a process that resembles eukaryotic phagocytosis, known as engulfment, the mother cell membranes migrate up and around the forespore. The completion of engulfment is marked by the mother cell membranes fusing at the forespore pole, releasing the immature spore into the mother cell cytoplasm where further spore maturation takes place. Three mother cell expressed proteins, SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP have been shown to mediate both the early step of engulfment, septal thinning and subsequent membrane migration. Research presented in this dissertation addresses how SpoIID, SpoIIM and SpoIIP are targeted to the sporulation septum, and in particular, the role of SpoIID during engulfment. My studies of the engulfment proteins led to the discovery of two pathways that are involved in targeting SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP (DMP) to the septum. Normally, SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP localize to the septum in a SpoIIB-dependent manner. However, in the absence of SpoIIB, cells were able to complete engulfment, albeit at a slower rate than wild type. This suggested the presence of a secondary, SpoIIB- independent pathway for targeting the DMP complex to the septum. In fact, my studies showed that a secondary, compensatory targeting pathway does exist, and is mediated by the SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH (Q-AH) zipper via the mother cell expressed proteins SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB. Thus, the Q-AH zipper not only provides a compensatory mechanism for membrane migration during engulfment when DMP activity is reduced, but also indirectly mediates a compensatory septal localization pathway for DMP when its primary targeting pathway is disrupted. My research also demonstrated that SpoIID functions as a peptidoglycan hydrolase. Site directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids within SpoIID has led to the identification of residues important for the proteins enzymatic activity as well as its function in vivo. I have thereby demonstrated that the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of SpoIID is required during engulfment, and have found mutations which suggest that SpoIID also functions later in sporulation, as they block spore formation but not membrane migration. In collaboration with the Popham lab at Virginia Tech, we have determined that SpoIID acts as an endopeptidase capable of cleaving the peptide cross-bridges that link adjoining glycan strands. These studies, in total, have added to our mechanistic knowledge of engulfment by further characterizing the biochemical activity of SpoIID and correlating its in vitro activities with its function in vivo"qwqwStefan Denis Aung

The photocatalytic activities of the CN-PANI composites were evaluated using methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) as model pollutants. The CN-PANI composites displayed much higher photocatalytic activity than the pure g-C3N4 and PANI under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of MO was higher than that of MB under same irradiation conditions, which was mainly attributed to the difference of adsorption processes. The different adsorption behaviors of MB and MO on composites were due to the fact that they carry different charge, i.e., MO and CN-PANI composites have the opposite charge, leading to the enhanced MO adsorption due to the strong electrostatic forces between them. Conversely, MB had the same charge with PANI, thus resulting in a low adsorption capacity due to the electrostatic repulsion. By careful investigation of the influence parameters, a possible mechanism was proposed, i.e., the synergistic effect of g-C3N4 and PANI was responsible for the effective photogenerated charge separation, the large specific surface area and the energy band structure."qwqwShouwei Zhang,School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230031, China;Lanping Zhao,Education Training Center of Ningxia Electric Power Company, Yinchuan, Ningxia 750011, China;Meiyi Zeng,School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230031, China;Jiaxing Li,Key Laboratory of Novel Thin Film Solar Cells, Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, PO Box 1126, 230031 Hefei, China;Jinzhang Xu,School of Materials Science and Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230031, China;Xiangke Wang,Key Laboratory of Novel Thin Film Solar Cells, Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, PO Box 1126, 230031 Hefei, China

Foto diambil dari foto  headline  di harian Tribun Medan. Penelitian ini memfokuskan pada penelitian kualitatif dengan analisis semiotika. Penelitian ini menggunakan paradigma konstruktivis sebagai pendekatan. Sedangkan pisau analisis atau instrumen analisa data, peneliti memakai semiotika Roland Barthes. Dalam penelitian ini, peneliti berusaha meneliti apa makna gambar yang ditampilkan lewat foto berita, serta bagaimana praktik ideologi media tersebut. Peneliti meneliti 18 fotojurnalistik dari harian Tribun Medan edisi Desember 2012 sampai Februari 2013. Sesuai  dengan perumusan masalah, yaitu “Apa makna dan bagaimanakah perempuan ditampilkan lewat fotojurnalistik pada foto  Headline  di Harian Tribun Medan“, peneliti mendapatkan hasil bahwa Tribun Medan mengkonstruksi perempuan sebagai sebuah kebutuhan media yang menginginkan konsep ringan dan enak dibaca. Perempuan digambarkan sebagai sosok yang menyukai kegiatan luar ruang dan memiliki kebebasan berekspresi. Sehingga pada akhirnya dapat disimpulkan bahwa Tribun Medan melalui fotografernya menganut ideologi konsumerisme.       Kata kunci :   Fotojurnalistik, Semiotika, Perempuan, Tribun Medan."qwqwSuryadi Suryadi,Universitas Sumatera Utara

Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, exploratory study in 20 healthy male volunteers who had an evening-type chronotype. In Period 1, participants were randomly assigned to take either ONR-8 or placebo for 2 weeks. In Period 2, the treatments were reversed in a crossover manner. To assess performance, participants took the Psychomotor Vigilance Test（PVT）twice: once in the morning and once after lunch at 0, 1, and 2 weeks of treatment. They also completed the Athens Insomnia Scale（AIS）, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale（ESS）, a visual analogue scale（VAS）for morning appetite, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire（MEQ）, and SF-36. In addition, autonomic nerve function and expression of Heat Shock Protein（HSP）70 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes were measured. Participants were asked to complete the OSA sleep inventory MA version during the study period and to record sleep parameters by actigraphy for 3 days prior to intake and continuously during the study period. Results The AIS score during the period of ONR-8 intake was significantly improved as compared with the placebo intake period. When we analyzed the PVT data excluding participants who fell asleep during the test, a significantly faster reaction time on the PVT after lunch was observed during the intake of ONR-8. There were no adverse clinical events throughout the study period. Conclusions These results suggest that ONR-8 improved sleep and daytime performance in evening-type individuals."qwqw加藤 真奈美,大塚製薬株式会社 大津栄養製品研究所;ほか

Se seleccionaron 48 ovejas de la razas Pelibuey Canelo y Katahdin, de una edad de 2,5±0,5 anos, con peso vivo de 45,0±5,0 kg y una condicion corporal de 2,5 a 4,0. Se utilizo un diseno completamente al azar, con 12 repeticiones y cuatro tratamientos, los cuales consistieron en la aplicacion del suplemento mineral via parenteral (SMP), como sigue: Tratamiento 1 (T1)=testigo (Vit ADE); T2=T1+(993 mg de P+45 mg de Se+Vit ADE); T3=T1+(993 mg de P+Vit D3+Vit ADE); y T4=T1+(670 mg de Zn+987 mg de Mg+795 mg de Ca+Vit ADE). Las variables productivas evaluadas fueron peso al nacimiento del cordero (PNC), peso al destete del cordero (PDC), ganancia de peso al destete (GPD). Mientras que el comportamiento reproductivo de las ovejas se evaluo mediante la prolificidad (PRO), porcentaje de gestacion (PGE), porcentaje de pariciones (PPA) y porcentaje de destetes (PDE). Las medias de PNC, PDC y GDP fueron 3,60, 12,43 y 0,21 kg, respectivamente, no se encontraron diferencias significativas (P>0,05) entre tratamientos. Estos resultados se mantuvieron en las caracteristicas reproductivas con una media de PRO de 1,3 y los PGE, PPA y PDE fueron 83,9, 83,9 y 96,2%, respectivamente.

From each of 6 sections in a field, oats were harvested, treated (INO) or not (CON) with inoculant, packed into 19-L BKT or vacuum bags (BG), and ensiled for 217 d. The inoculant added contained  Lactobacillus buchneri  and  Pediococcus pentosaceus  (4 × 10 5  and 1 × 10 5  cfu/g of fresh oats, respectively). The experimental design was a complete randomized design replicated 6 times. Treatment design was the factorial combination of 2 S × 2 I. Some differences existed between BG versus BKT at silo opening (217 d), including a decreased CP (7.73 vs. 7.04 ± 0.247% of DM) and ethanol (1.93 vs. 1.55 ± 0.155) and increased lactic acid (4.28 vs. 3.65 ± 0.241), respectively. Also, WSC and mold counts were reduced in BG versus BKT for CON (1.78 vs. 2.70 ± 0.162% of DM and 0.8 vs. 2.82 ± 0.409 log cfu/fresh g) but not for INO (∼1.53 and 1.55), respectively. Application of INO increased DM recovery (96.1 vs. 92.9 ± 0.63%), aerobic stability (565 vs. 133 ± 29.2 h), acetic acid (2.38 vs. 1.22 ± 0.116% of DM), and reduced NDF (65.0 vs. 67.0 ± 0.57), ADF (36.7 vs. 38.1 ± 0.60), ethanol (0.63 vs. 2.85 ± 0.155), and yeast counts (1.10 vs. 4.13 ± 0.484 log cfu/fresh g) in INO versus CON, respectively. At d 0, no differences were found for S and I on the nutritional composition and background microbial counts.  Leuconostocaceae  (82.9 ± 4.27%) and  Enterobacteriaceae  (15.2 ± 3.52) were the predominant bacterial families and unidentified sequences were predominant for fungi. A higher relative abundance of the  Davidiellaceae  fungal family (34.3 vs. 19.6 ± 4.47) was observed in INO versus CON. At opening (217 d), INO had a lower relative abundance of  Leuconostocaceae  (42.3 vs. 95.8 ± 4.64) and higher  Lactobacillaceae  (57.4 vs. 3.9 ± 4.65) versus CON. Despite several differences were found between BKT and BG, both techniques can be comparable for characterizing effects of INO on the most basic measures used in silage evaluation. The use of inoculant improved oat silage quality partially by a shift in the bacterial community composition during ensiling, which mainly consisted of an increased relative abundance of  Lactobacillaceae  and reduction of  Leuconostocaceae  relative to CON."qwqwJ.

Lewis acids inhibit the photochemical deconjugation of ..cap alpha..,..beta..- to ..beta..,..gamma..-unsaturated butenoic esters and shift the photoequilibrium between E and Z isomers toward the Z isomer. As such, irradiation of E ..cap alpha..,..beta..-unsaturated esters in the presence of EtAlCl/sub 2/ provides a convenient method for the preparation of the thermodynamically less stable Z isomer. Irradiation of methyl (E,E)-2,4-hexadienoate and methyl (E,E)-5-phenyl-2,4-pentadienoate in the absence of added catalysts results in nonselective E,Z isomerization to give mixtures of all four stereoisomers in roughly comparable yields. In the presence of the Broensted acid trifluoroacetic acid, quantitative conversion of methyl 2,4-hexadienoates to methyl 3,4-hexadienoate is observed. The acid serves as a catalyst for the thermal 1,3-hydrogen shift of an allenic enol ester formed via a photochemical 1,5-hydrogen shift of the conjugated esters. Irradiation of the ground-state complexes of the conjugated esters with the Lewis acids EtAlCl/sub 2/ or BF/sub 3/ results in selective E,Z isomerization about the ..cap alpha..,..beta..-double bond in methyl 2,4-hexadienoate and the ..gamma..,delta-double bond in methyl 5-phenyl-24-pentadienoate. The mechanistic bases for the observed effects of Lewis acids are selective excitationmore » of the more strongly absorbing E complex and more efficient isomerization of the excited E vs. Z complex.« less"qwqwFrederick D.

In a series of five experiments, EDTA, lauric acid (LA), nisin, and combinations of the three antimicrobial agents were incorporated into a corn zein film and exposed to broth cultures of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis for 48 h (sampled at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h). Four experiments used starting cultures of 10 8  CFU/ml in separate experiments tested against each bacterium; the fifth experiment examined the inhibitory effect of selected antimicrobial agents on Salmonella Enteritidis with an initial inoculum of 104 CFU/ml. L. monocytogenes cell numbers decreased by greater than 4 logs after 48 h of exposure to films containing LA and nisin alone. No cells were detected for L. monocytogenes (8-log reduction) after 24-h exposure to any film combination that included LA. Of all film agent combinations tested, none had greater than a 1-log reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis when a 10 8 -CFU/ml broth culture was used. When a 10 4  CFU/ml of Salmonella Enteritidis initial inoculum was used, the films with EDTA and LA and EDTA, LA, and nisin were bacteriostatic. However, there was a 5-log increase in cells exposed to control within 24 h. The results demonstrate bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic activity of films containing antimicrobial agents."qwqwK. L.

The subjects were randomly divided into three study groups. Glycolic acid peels with 20%, 35%, 50%, and 70% concentrations were applied serially at 2-week intervals to 23 patients in Group A. Twenty patients in Group B used a 15% glycolic acid cream once or twice daily for a period of 24 weeks. The remaining 15 patients in Group C applied a placebo cream twice daily during the same period.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Results  The differences between the results in the different groups were statistically significant at week 24 (P < 0.001). Home application of low-strength glycolic acid was better tolerated and had less side-effects than glycolic acid peels; however, repeated short-contact 70% glycolic acid peels provided superior results compared with the maintenance regimen (P < 0.05), and apparently good responses were observed only in the peel group (P < 0.01).#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Conclusions  Glycolic acid peeling is an effective modality for the treatment of atrophic acne scars, but repetitive peels (at least six times) with 70% concentration are necessary to obtain evident improvement. Long-term daily use of low-strength products may also have some useful effects on scars and may be recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the peeling procedure."qwqwZulal Erbagci,Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey;Cenk Akcali,Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey

The technique can be used to rapidly generate wide area, 2D thermal maps, for example, on microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) structures. The captured IR images will provide a good approximate temperature distribution, however, they may suffer from temperature errors, which occur when low emissivity metals and optically transparent semiconductor materials are studied. Although a high emissivity coating can be applied to improve the measurement accuracy, the coating can cause heat spreading, which distorts the measured temperature profile. Additionally, the coating may also damage delicate devices and visually obscure areas for inspection."qwqwR. H.

In mammals, ERKs participate in the regulation of spermatogenesis, mature spermatozoa motility, hyperactivation, and the acrosome reaction. To investigate ERK functions in Eriocheir sinensis reproduction, we successfully cloned the full-length ERK from the testis of E. sinensis (ES-ERK). The 1098-nucleotide open reading frame encodes a 365-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 42 kDa. Expressions of ES-ERK in different tissues and testis development stages were detected by the quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. ES-ERK is expressed relatively highly in the testis. The expression of ES-ERK protein gradually increased in the spermatid stage, reaching a peak in sperm stage. Western blotting showed a similar expression pattern for the total ES-ERK protein, but phospho-ERK (p-ERK) showed the higher expression in spermatid than sperm stage. We also used trypan blue and hematoxylin and eosin staining to identify structural changes in E. sinensis spermatozoa during the process of acrosome reaction (AR). After stimulating the process of AR, the ES-ERK has translocated from the nucleus to the acrosomal tubule. This result suggested that the ERK MAPK might be involved in the regulation of the E. sinensis acrosome reaction."qwqwWen-Juan Sun,School of Life Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China;Ming Zhu,School of Life Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China;Yuan-Li Wang,School of Life Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China;Qing Li,School of Life Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China;Hongdan Yang,School of Life Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China;Z.

Patients and Methods  Forty-three women with 44 breast lesions were prospectively enrolled. Eligible patients underwent lumpectomy followed by a CT simulation (CT1) within 60 days of surgery. Patients were treated to the entire breast to a dose of 45–50.4 Gy. After 21–23 treatments, a second planning CT simulation (CT2) was done. The LPC was contoured on CT2, and the volumes (LCV) were compared between CT1 and CT2.  Results  The median LCV on CT1 and CT2 was 38.2 cm 3  and 21.7 cm 3 , respectively. The median percent change and volume decrease between CT1 and CT2 was −32.0% and 11.2 cm 3 , respectively ( n  = 44). The LCV decreased in 38 of 44 patients (86%). There was a significant correlation between initial LCV and decrease in volume ( p  = 0.001) and initial LCV and percent decrease in volume ( p    Conclusions  Patients who undergo lumpectomy almost always have a decrease in their LCV during whole-breast RT. There was a correlation between the initial LCV and decrease in volume on repeat CT simulation. Evaluating patients for this change can potentially lead to decreased doses of radiation to the remaining breast and other critical structures when delivering a small-field boost. Repeat CT simulation should be considered in patients with larger cavities or cavities near critical structures."qwqwTodd W.

Consequently, prolonged and widespread use of ball projection machines for practice of interceptive actions may lack theoretical foundation because they afford information-specifying variables which are not present in competitive performance. To examine this issue, timing and coordination of the forward defensive stroke in cricket batting were examined in experienced batters under two typical practice task constraints: batting against a representative 'real' bowler (B) and a representative bowling machine (BM) (mean delivery velocity 26.76 m s-1 under both conditions). Results showed significant adaptation of coordination and timing under the different practice task constraints. For example, initiation of the backswing was later against a bowler and downswing was faster with a different ratio of backswing–downswing when batting in the BM condition (47%: 53%) compared to B (54%: 46%). Peak bat height differed under the two constraints (BM: 1.56m, s=19.89 m and B: 1.72m, s=10.36 m). Mean length of front foot stride was shorter against the BM (0.55m, s=0.07 m) compared to B (0.59m, s=0.06 m). Correlation between initiation of backswing and front foot movement was much higher against B (r=0.88) than BM (r=0.65). Results suggested that coaches should ensure opportunities for regular practice against 'real' bowlers, so that batters become attuned to the information available for pick up in those specific practice constraints. Projectile machines may be best used under special conditions in which coaches randomise the bounce point and deliver balls at slower speeds to allow batters to sample early ball flight before selecting shot responses."qwqwIan Renshaw;Anthony R.H.

As the extension of offline bin-packing problem, periodic task scheduling has many important applications in real-time distributed systems. For time triggered CAN control systems, two strategies to determine the basic cycle (BC) of TTCAN are presented. Next-fit algorithm, next-fit descending algorithm, best-fit algorithm and best-fit descending algorithm are proposed to construct periodic task scheduling tables.

Statistical data treatments for the detection and elimination of outliers and extremums were performed using five methods: (i) data visualization (or raw data statistics); (ii) mean ( x ) and standard deviation (s) calculation after eliminating outliers with s x 2 ± ; (iii) median and median absolute difference (MAD); (iv) Huber method; and (v) single-outlier type multiple test method involving Dixon, Grubbs, skewness and kurtosis tests at 99% confidence level. The results are reported in scientific notation with one significant digit of uncer tainty. A comparative study of all the five statistical data treatment methods suggests that the fifth method provides better results for the statistical analysis of experimental measurements. A preliminary evaluation for the analytical accuracy of geochemical analysis of geothermal waters, prepared by dissolving 4.585 g CaCl 2 (98.2%), 16.5 g NaCl (99.9%), 3.58 g MgCl 2 (99.0%), 0.74 g Na 2 SO 4 (99.0%) and 0.95 g KCl (99.5%) in 1 liter of solution, is presented. The analysis of Na + and K + are reasonably accurate, while Mg 2+ and SO 4 2- have high inaccuracy. The accuracy of Ca 2+ and Cl - analyses is in-between. A systematic analysis of the results suggests that the present inaccuracy in the measurements of Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , SO 4 2- and Cl - are probably associated with the sample preparation. The relations between the coefficient of variation (i.e. % analytical uncertainty) and concentration of each element are derived, which are used for the propagation of uncertainty in the geochemical calculations of geothermal systems. The uncertainty propagation procedure is illustrated in the calculation of Los Azufres geothermal reservoir temperature and vapor fraction.

So far, obligations of poor countries seem to be taken as given yet the behavior of governments in poor countries and occurrences therein attest to the contrary;  this suggests a need to mainstream these obligations in discussions about global justice. If poor countries do not live up to these requirements obstacles arise to the realization of global justice; and they act unjustly in relation to citizens of rich countries which provide them with aid.

Few practical cross cultural studies have been conducted in construction due to the complexity, richness, abstractness and subtlety of national differences. Culture is a disputed concept whose meaning depends on the context of its use. Knowledge- Event Management (KEM), using audio diaries to capture knowledge events and debriefing to analyse and transfer knowledge, has been chosen to enquiry into construction practice in different countries as it accesses deep knowledge in practice. It is proposed that those real-life knowledge events contain rich contents from which not only the embedded tacit knowledge can be extracted and then shared but also some national differences in cultural pattern of learning and practicing may be detected. This paper presents two typical knowledge events collected from construction professionals in Britain and China respectively and uses a cross-culture lens to identify differences in people's thinking and learning as well as their practice in construction. The findings present evidence of different national construction practices and link these to cultural differences. This will surface learning to assist international projects and for the learning of international students."qwqwHong Xiao;David Boyd

The results show that both of the ”anaerobic” wastewater treatment and the sludge anaerobic digestion make the organic compounds in sludge so complicated that the organic compounds decomposition and release temperature becomes higher during pyrolyzing, and the ”aerobic+anaerobic” process makes the organic compounds in sludge more complicated than the ”anaerobic +aerobic” process. There is no influence on the combustion process and the burnout point, but can make the combustion temperature of sludge higher. The thermal reaction mechanisms have been studied with Satava-Sestak equation. It shows that the pyrolysis mechanism of these sludges is a process of volatile diffusion at first and then the chemical reaction function, while the combustion mechanism of them is a process of chemical reaction and diffusion function."qwqwLiping Xie,Chemical Engineering,Tianjin Polytechnic University,Tianjin 300160,China);Shimei Zheng;Tao Li

of the most essential challenges for opening new lines of neuro-scientific inquiry. Recent developments with MRI analysis of structural connectivity, anatomical brain segmentation, cortical surface parcellation, and functional imaging have yielded fantastic advances in our ability to probe the neurological structure-function relationship in vivo. To date, the image analysis efforts in each of these areas have typically focused on a single modality. Here, we extend the cortical reconstruction using implicit surface evolution (CRUISE) methodology to perform efficient, consistent, and topologically correct analyses in a natively multi-parametric manner. This effort combines and extends state-of-the-art techniques to simultaneously consider and analyze structural and diffusion information alongside quantitative and functional imaging data. Robust and consistent estimates of the cortical surface extraction, cortical labeling, diffusion-inferred contrasts, diffusion tractography, and subcortical parcellation are demonstrated in a scan-rescan paradigm. Accompanying this demonstration, we present a fully automated software system complete with validation data."qwqwBennett A.

However, little is known regarding the status of intrahepatic DCs in HBV infection.  Methods  Based on availability, 11 recipient liver samples were obtained from acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) patients who had undergone liver transplantation. The frequencies, phenotypes, and functions of intrahepatic DC subsets were analyzed.  Results  Both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) extensively infiltrated the liver of the ACHBLF patients and expressed mature phenotypes therein. In particular, activated hepatic pDCs produced interferon (IFN)-α, which subsequently induced interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 production via toll-like receptor-9 ligation in liver-infiltrating lymphocytes cultured  in vitro . However, blockade of IFN-α production significantly reduced the cytokine production of the LILs. Further, a significantly low frequency of peripheral pDCs and highly reduced IFN-α production were observed in a large cohort of the ACHBLF patients, particularly in the non-survivors. Moreover, a persistently upregulated expression of hepatic IFN-α-associated genes was observed in the ACHBLF patients during disease progression.  Conclusions  Activated pDCs accumulated in large numbers in the liver of the ACHBLF patients and regulated local immune responses in chronic HBV infection."qwqwZheng Zhang,Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China;Zhengsheng Zou,The Forth Department of Clinic, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China;Junliang Fu,Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China;Lun Cai,Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China;Lei Jin,Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China;Yong-Jun Liu,Department of Immunology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, USA;Fu-Sheng Wang,Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 302 Hospital, Beijing 100039, China

While extensive research works have been performed on algorithm development, limited attention has been paid in how to form the sensor pairs. In the literature, most of the works adopt a centralized sensor pairing strategy, where only one common sensor node is chosen as the reference. However, due to the multi-hop nature of WSNs, it is well known that this kind of centralized signal processing method is power consuming since raw measurement data is involved in the transmissions. To reduce the requirements for both network bandwidth and power consumptions, we propose an in-network sensor pairing method to collect the TDOA measurements while guaranteeing the quality of source localization. The solution involves finding a minimal sized dominating set (MSDS) for a graph of the muti-hop network. It has been proved that in-network sensor pairing can result in the same Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) as the centralized one but at a far more less communication cost. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed in-network sensor pairing coincides with the decentralized source localization, which is an important application of our method."qwqwWei Meng,Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore;Lihua Xie,Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore;Wendong Xiao,University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China

Appl. Phys.50, #R##N#5642 (#R##N#1979), we use a perturbation scheme to obtain a higher-order expression for the steady-state photorefractive effect at large modulation depths and moderate applied electric fields. The expression is applicable for paraelectric crystals for which there is no photovoltaic effect and under conditions of weak coupling. The dependence of the size of the correction term on modulation depth, concentration of donor–trap sites, and applied field is discussed. Comparison of both the first-order and the second-order theories to the Kukhtarev model, valid for small modulation depths, allows the range of validity to be quantified for certain regimes."qwqwEllen Ochoa,Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405;Frederick Vachss,Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405;Lambertus Hesselink,Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 93405

Hence it has been proposed that the somites form by embryonic induction, but since no single tissue has been found to be essential, this concept has become less credible. Instead, the segmentation process appears to take place in two major steps: (1) as the node regresses, an early programming establishes the number and bilaterality of the somites, occurring as a wave of change passing from the anterior to the posterior end of the body; (2) after an interval of about 20 h, a second wave passes down the body and converts the programmed cells into somites. This theory is supported by morphological and experimental evidence. The regressing node appears to have two roles. First, is divides the presumptive somite mesoderm into right and left sides and thus establishes the symmetry and pairing of the somites. Secondly, it sets the clock for the segmentation process.

A design methodology was developed for decentralized PID controllers in coordinated boiler-turbine control systems. The approach was based on an analysis of Nyquist stability, Gershgorin bands, and diagonal dominance. With a suitable precompensator, the ultimate gain and ultimate frequency of each loop can be calculated. The tuning rule can be used to design simple decentralized PID controllers. Simulation results illustrated the dynamic performance, the disturbance rejection and the robustness of the control system."qwqwTang Duoyuan,Department of Thermal Engineering,  Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China)

The absence of osmium and no progress of the dihydroxylation reaction with the filtrate samples withdrawn periodically during the reaction rule out the leaching of osmium unambiguously and provide evidence for the heterogeneity of the reaction.

In this study a patient who came to the emergency service having a complaint of sudden loss of vision is introduced with an account of investigations, Noromyelitis Optica (NMO) was diagnosed. Case Report: The 38-year-old woman patient sometimes had a complaint of not seeing clearly for a week and applied to our emergency service with the symptom of loss of vision. In the emergency service, we initially carried out cranial computed tomography scanning. There were no pathological results. It was suspected that the patient has optical neuritis, but in her history, there was no reported use of toxical matter or medicine. The results of a cranial magnetic resonance survey revealed some hyperintense lesions (demyelination areas), predominantly on the T2 segment around the optic chiasma and optic nerves. Conclusion: Thus, even in rare cases, emergency service doctors must take demyelination illnesses such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or NMO into consideration in the differential diagnosis of acute loss of vision."qwqwMustafa Serinken;Mücahit Avcil

The instrument's design is well suited to underwater applications. Any combination of light sources (flashlamps, CW sources, or lasers) and spectral filters (absorption or interference) can be simultaneously incorporated to provide a single isotropic source with any desired temporal and spectral characteristics. This design was recently used in an underwater experiment that required a synchronously triggered isotropic flash to simultaneously measure absorption, scattering, and attenuation. The design of this particular isotropic source is presented along with data demonstrating the isotropy of the light field produced by the source.© (1991) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

A new experimental procedure is proposed to quantify the free swelling of its main constitutive clay phase, which is a key parameter to model the hydromechanical behaviour of this rock. The material was pulverised finely enough to remove any local stress that may prevent the free swelling induced by a change in water content. Powders were observed using an environmental scanning electron microscope and images recorded at various degrees of relative humidity were analysed by digital image correlation techniques to measure swelling strains. The investigation showed that the free swelling is moderate in comparison to other expansive clays (e.g. bentonite MX80). The magnitude of deformation becomes significant at high relative humidity. This swelling is not reversible and residual contraction is found after a wetting/drying cycle. These results confirm and provide a possible interpretation..."qwqwL. Wang;M. Bornert;S. Chanchole;E.

The aim of this study was to evaluate, “in vitro”,  Lactobacillus  strains originated from one year old children fecal material in the selection of probiotic microorganisms. Two commercial strains,  L. casei  (Lc 01 TM  )  and  L. acidophilus  (La-05  TM ) were used as controls. The first screening resulted in 75 colonies and they were isolated from six samples faeces. Isolates were Gram positive, mostly rod shaped ( cocobacilli , long and thin rods) and rarely  cocci . They were submitted to catalase test and evaluated for the presence of spores, resulting in 30 pre-selected strains. Among those strains, eight strains: L4, L5, L12, L19, L20, L22, L23, L24 were the most resistant to Oxgall (bile salts) concentration (0.3 w/v). These eight strains were also resistant to acid conditions (pH 3.0) and all strains were able to grow in the presence of 0.3 w/v of phenol. The results of treatments were compared to the Neuman Keuls Student test at 5% of probability, with regression analyses made at different times for tolerance to intestinal conditions. The results demonstrated that all these strains were able to survive under gastrointestinal stress condition, indicating potential use as probiotics. The high survival rate of probiotic strains, in conditions that simulate the gastrointestinal transit, is strain dependent and thus, a proper selection of strains in the development of dairy probiotic products is vital."qwqwMagali Soares dos Santos Pozza,Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paraná;Lucia Helena da Silva Miglioranza,Universidade Estadual de Londrina;José Eduardo Garcia,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;Sandra Garcia,Universidade Estadual de Londrina;Paulo Cesar Pozza,Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paraná.

Es wird durch nach wie vor starke gegenlaufige Faktoren gebremst, da private Haushalte, Finanzinstitute, Nichtfinanzunternehmen und letztlich auch die Regierungen ihre Finanzlage sanieren mussen.

Presented is a derivation involving time reversal invariance, along with an assumption of a canonical distribution of states in the solid, which results in a reciprocity relationship for the surface scattering cross section that yields the cosine law at equilibrium. A symmetry property for the scattered particle flux results from the reciprocity relationship, and molecular beam data are shown to exhibit the indicated symmetry. An application of this previously unrecognized symmetry permits the prediction of the scattered particle flux distribution for an arbitrary angle of incidence from experimental data reported for a limited number of incident angles."qwqwE.

The fluid is confined in a rapidly rotating, electrically insulating, rigid spherical container. In the first instance the influence of differential rotation on established magnetic instabilities is studied. These can belong to either the ideal or the resistive class, both of which have been the subject of extensive research in parts I and II of this series. It was found there, that in the absence of differential rotation, ideal modes (driven by gradients of B 0) become unstable for Ac ≳ 200 whereas resistive instabilities (generated by magnetic reconnection processes near critical levels, i.e. zeros of B0) require Ac ≳ 50.

We conducted a quantitative assessment of the distributional changes of these BTPD colonies during the periods 1988–2000 and 2000–2005 focusing on the potential roles of plant biomass, landscape configuration, habitat loss, and habitat suitability. We used remote sensing and GIS tools to characterize habitat and landscape conditions at areas of extinction and persistence at the beginning of each period. Based on this information, we contrasted areas of extinction and persistence within single BTPD colonies, and used logistic regression to model extinction of entire colonies. The greatest levels of reduction, fragmentation and extinction of colonies occurred between 1988 and 2000. The trend of reduction continued between 2000 and 2005 because the largest colony became smaller and fragmented, driving the area down, however, the rest of the towns showed a marginal increase. During the first period, extinction of entire colonies was higher in smaller colonies occupying low-biomass areas. Both extinction models and raw data indicate that colony area lost to agriculture and urbanization was relatively low for both periods. Because the period exhibiting the highest colony area loss coincided with a severe period of drought (1994–1995), we hypothesized that an unusually high food shortage could be the driving force behind this generalized reduction in colonies. Our results suggest that BTPD populations are sensitive to size and isolation effects mainly in the context of severe drought. Because changes in precipitation have profound impacts on plant productivity and composition in arid ecosystems, BTPD populations at the southernmost edge of their geographic range are especially vulnerable to drought and desertification processes, and therefore to climate disruption."qwqwRafael Avila-Flores,Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada T6G 2E9;Gerardo Ceballos,Instituto de Ecología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Circuito Exterior s/n, Ciudad Universitaria Coyoacán, Mexico DF 04510, Mexico;Alejandra de Villa-Meza,Cal y Mayor y Asociados, S.C., Dr. Pallares y Portillo 174, Col.

It is concluded that the dye penetrates the vacuoles chiefly in the form of free base and not as salt.#N##N#The dye from methylene blue solution containing azure B free base as impurity penetrates and accumulates in the vacuole. This dye must be azure B in the form of free base, since it raises the pH value of the sap to about the same extent as the free base of azure B dissolved in the sap in vitro . The dye absorbed by the chloroform from methylene blue solution behaves like the dye penetrating the vacuole. These results confirm those of spectrophotometric analysis previously published.#N##N#Crystal violet exists only in one form between pH 5 and pH 9.2, and does not alter the pH value of the sap at the concentrations used. It does not penetrate readily unless cells are injured.#N##N#A theory of "multiple partition coefficients" is described which explains the mechanism of the behavior of living cells to these dyes.#N##N#When the protoplasm is squeezed into the sap, the pH value of the mixture is higher than that of the pure sap. The behavior of such a mixture to the dye is very much like that of the sap except that with azure B and methylene blue the rise in the pH value of such a mixture is not so pronounced as with sap when the dye penetrates into the vacuoles.#N##N#Spectrophotometric measurements show that the dye which penetrates from methylene blue solution has a primary absorption maximum at 653 to 655 mµ (i.e., is a mixture of azure B and methylene blue, with preponderance of azure B) whether we take the sap alone or the sap plus protoplasm.#N##N#These results confirm those previously obtained with spectrophotometric measurements."qwqwMarian Irwin

To provide a theoretically understanding the phenomenon, we held a review of the literature on the concept, process and individual and organizational factors associated with the development of collective competences.The study, qualitative in nature, was carried out with managers and servers of the Department of Human Resources Management (DHRM) from University, through the realization of interviews and focus groups. The analysis of the results allowed the identification of eight determinants of collective competences development. Some factors identified represent limitations in the development in collective level and others facilitate this development. The absence of team unity is a limiting factor in the development of collective competence due to the fragmentation of activities and the lack of integration between the coordinators. From the results of the study, the research brings a theoretical and practical contribution to the public sector context. In relation to theoretical contribution, the study brings together the main approaches on the subject that oriented the proposed categorization in the results, enabling a broader analysis of the conceptual aspects and allows for a critical evaluation of the dissemination of the National Policy of Personal Development. As a practical contribution, the study presents elements that can support a project of management competences in the social context of the research, as well as in other public institutions. Both the barriers identified, as the determining factors of the collective competences, as described in this paper, can be useful in planning the deployment of a system of management competences, not just focusing on the individual, but worried about the collective environment. Although the study has been carried out in a specific context (SRH), of a specific University (UFCG), we believe that the results of this research can also characterize other institutional contexts, in relation to historical, cultural and social trajectory that is marked by legal provisions that guide strategic and operational decisions of human resource management in IFES."qwqwJandmara de Oliveira Lima,Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brasil;Anielson Barbosa da Silva,Universidade Federal da Paraíba, João Pessoa, Brasil

While the effectiveness of a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic (CRRC) has been shown not to differ between those with and without mental health conditions, it is unknown whether patients with mental health conditions would differ in durability of success following discharge from the CRRC.Objective:To determine the effect of mental health conditions on the maintenance of glycemic control and blood pressure control in patients with diabetes following successful completion of a CRRC program.Methods:Patients were discharged from the CRRC when therapeutic goals of hemoglobin A1c (A1C) <7% and blood pressure <130/80 mm Hg were achieved. We performed a retrospective chart review of a cohort of 231 patients by quarterly intervals for A1C and systolic blood pressure (SBP), providing up to 3 years of data following discharge from the CRRC.

The gyration tensor component g33 calculated from the gyrations measured in these two directions was found to be in good agreement with the value of g33 measured by other workers in the direction of the c-axis (the optical axis) by conventional methods."qwqwHiromichi Horinaka;Kazushi Tomii;Hajimu Sonomura;Takeshi Miyauchi

Drawing on interviews with 46 Boston-area complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners who treat breast cancer patients, we found that the CAM practitioners redefine their patients’ breast cancer diagnoses in ways that expand and transform their illness, sometimes into a lifetime journey. The practitioners, for the most part, espouse broad and complex etiological frameworks that help give meaning to the woman's cancer. They tend to speak about breast cancer as a symptom of problems that exceed the cancer itself, at times suggesting that women are responsible, to some extent, for their own breast cancer. The practitioners articulate holistic philosophies that describe healing as open-ended with correspondingly expansive definitions of what it means to be healed, rarely articulating clear ways of conceptualising or measuring the efficacy of their own treatments. Their use of expansive and detailed etiological frameworks alongside vague and unelaborated efficacy frameworks make up the holistic sickening phenomenon described in this paper."qwqwSusan Sered,Department of Sociology, Suffolk University, Boston, USA;Amy Agigian,Department of Sociology, Suffolk University, Boston, USA

This volume addresses this problem by providing a handbook on the subject, not conceived as a generalized and anecdotal survey of teaching, but one which approaches specific problems and specific poems. Divided into two sections, the book discusses problems that arise in the classroom when introducing 18th-century verse to undergraduates, when teaching the couplet form and approaching complicated questions of satire and parody, when presenting to students a "nature" poetry very different from a kind they are accustomed to, and when teaching mid- and late-18th- century verse. Part 2 includes a series of essays, each (a) developing a specific strategy for teaching one poem or group of poems and (b) ending with suggestions of how this strategy might work for other poems by the same poet. The poets considered include Dryden, Pope, Johnson, and Blake as well as Swift, Gray and others."qwqwPeter Sabor;Christopher Fox

Every year 56,967 women in Europe and USA die as a consequence of this disease. The incidence of ovarian cancer is forecast to undergo a 13 % increase in the next eight years in the seven major developed countries to reach about 72,000 annual cases in 2019. Due to the limitations of the current therapeutic approaches, there is a strong need for novel, more efficient, therapies. For this reason, we have produced a humanized monoclonal antibody 3C23K targeting the human Mullerian Inhibiting Substance type II Receptor (MISRII), expressed on most ovarian cancer subtypes, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) representing more than 90% of ovarian cancers. This monoclonal antibody derives from the murine monoclonal antibody 12G4 and displays a particular glycosylation profile known to favor effector recruitment (EMABling®) as previously demonstrated in vitro. In vivo, we also showed that 3C23K exhibited a significant effect on tumor growth against several ovarian tumor xenografted models derived from patient primary EOC tumors. In this study, we first confirmed by peptide microarray that the epitope of 3C23K antibody was strictly identical to that of 12G4 antibody and a 3D-model of the full MISRII molecule was generated in order to better localize the 3C23K epitope. Furthermore, SPR studies demonstrated cross-reactivity of 3C23K with MISRII of rabbit, dog, pig, cow and primate. In vivo, antitumor activity of 3C23K against xenografted EOC tumor models was confirmed with various concentrations and treatment schedules. Moreover, interestingly, we constructed a mutant form of 3C23K harboring two mutations in the Fc region (G236R/L328R) in order to prevent binding to both murine and human FcαRs, and demonstrated that such a modification abolished antitumor activity. This data confirmed in vivo that recruitment of effectors is essential for 3C23K efficacy. Finally, in order to anticipate clinical treatment of ovarian cancers, 3C23K was tested in vivo in combination with carboplatin. Combination, when compared with treatment of each product alone, resulted in more than additive antitumor activity. Altogether these data showed that humanized monoclonal antibody 3C23K represents a promising candidate for ovarian cancer immunotherapy.#N##N#Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} abstract.

Mullite obtained by this route could be sintered to as high as 98% of theoretical density in under 60 min. A detailed structural investigation has been carried out using XRD, IR, and MAS NMR. It is clearly evident from the structural studies that there is a partial conversion of octahedral Al to tetrahedral Al with time during the formation of mullite. Also, it is evident that the exsolved SiO 2  reacts with the added Al 2 O 3  to form secondary mullite over primary mullite which is nucleated from the decomposition of kaolinite. A detailed microstructural evolution of this conversion has been followed. A possible microwave-material interaction has been discussed for the rapid formation of mullite."qwqwM. Panneerselvam;K. J.

Then the lesion was elevated above the skin and clearly palpated as a hard spherical tumor, small hen's egg-sized. The tumor was diagnosed as lipoma in the muscle based on local aspects and imaging findings obtained by CT and ultrasonography. Operation was performed. The excised specimen, 3.5cm in size and not encapsulated, was pathologically intramuscular lipoma of infiltrating type. Intramuscular lipomas are rare and most of them show a tendency to replace muscle tissue by fat growth differently from typical subdermal lipomas.

Whereas the pathomechanism of the secondary mitochondrial dysfunction has been extensively studied, that of the leukoencephalopathy has not been elucidated. We hypothesized that the white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images reflect disturbance of blood–brain barrier function. Albumin immunohistochemistry disclosed quantitative (p < 0.01) and qualitative differences between the mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy and control brains, indicating that loss of thymidine phosphorylase function impairs the integrity of the blood–brain barrier.

Chemical control has been one of the most widely used methods for weed mana gement in corn. However, the use of herbicides can cause adverse effects on beneficial insects, such as egg parasitoids. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the selectivity of 12 herbicides regis tered for corn at the immature stages of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) under laboratory conditions (temperature 25±1 o C, relative humidity 70±10%; photoperiod 14 hours). The herbicides were diluted in a proportion of 200 L of water per hectare and sprayed on lepidopteran eggs containing immature forms of the parasitoids, at the egg-larva, prepupae and pupae stages. The emergence percentage of parasitoids was evaluated, and, when compared with the control, the herbicides were classified as harmless (class 1,  99%). The herbicides Agrisato 480 SL, Finale, Glifos, Glifosato Nortox, Gliz 480 SL, Polaris, Roundup Original, Roundup Transorb, Roundup WG, Trop and Zapp Qi were classified as harmless (class 1) at different immature stages of T. pretiosum, and considered selective to the parasitoid. Although harmless at the egg larva and prepupae stages, Gramoxone 200 was classified as slightly harmful (class 2) at the pupae stage. Accordingly, to better reconcile the che mical management of weeds with the biological control of insects, the use of herbicides allowing greater survival of T. pretiosum is suggested, whenever possible."qwqwG.J.

Because of using codes to define the shape mode, the setting operation becomes easy. In order to form one injection speed control pattern, a mix of shape modes may be utilized. Also, in the present setting method, a plurality of code data predeterminedly defined are input sequentially in time, thereby setting the injection speed control pattern or pressure holding control pattern.

The objective is to develop the international library cooperation agenda for life-long education proliferation. User groups in Korea, China, and Japan were investigated to understand the differences in library awareness based on the situational contexts such as preferred resources, use frequency, educational level, and gender. Results of the data analysis showed the correlation between library anxiety and use patterns such as preferred information sources and frequency of use. Specifically, the user group in China has the highest level of library anxiety with every factor. Also, the Korean user group was measured to have the lowest level of library anxiety in terms of digital information factor. Based on these results, the study presents several recommendations for resolving library anxiety such as embracing new information need with regard to environmental change and suggesting a new space policy for libraries."qwqwMi-Hyang Park

evaluation. We propose a four-phase non-full swing keeper design to solve this dilemma. Non-full swing switching at the keeper gate together with alleviated contention help to reduce power consumption and delay. Simulation of 16-input OR gate using 0.13/spl mu/m CMOS SPICE parameters shows that proposed keeper design can reduce power consumption and delay by 26% and 24%, respectively."qwqwGe Yang,Dept. of Electr.

Maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of AP and chemically modified apple pomace (CMAP) were found to be 83.33 and 256.41 mg g−1, respectively, using Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Negative zeta potential was increased about 44 % on the surface of AP after chemical modification. The amount of adsorbent dose and time were decreased from 0.8 to 0.4 g and 120 to 30 min, respectively. Plausible mechanism supported by FTIR data showed that –OH, –COO, –CO, –C–O–C, –CONH2 and –NH2 groups were involved in adsorption of Ni2+ ions by coordinate bonding with lone pair of negatively charged oxygen and nitrogen groups for AP and CMAP. Negative value of ∆H° indicated exothermic nature of reaction and adsorption decreased as temperature increases from 303 to 333 K. Desorption and regeneration study revealed that CMAP was reused in three cycles, which make biosorbent more economical. By surface modification of AP, adsorption capacity was increased about 3.0-fold than unmodified one."qwqwPiar Chand,Hill Area Tea Science Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, India;Yogesh B.

Research also indicates that musicians have high levels of subjective health complaints, complaints with limited or no objective findings. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between subjective health complaints, stress, and coping in musicians. Thirty-five musicians in the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra filled in questionnaires about work, subjective health complaints, and coping. Saliva samples were collected to measure cortisol levels. The levels of subjective health complaints compared well with normative data from a representative sample of Norwegians, except for an unusually high level of “pseudoneurological” complaints (fatigue, mood changes). High levels of cortisol were positively related to the total number of subjective health complaints, gastrointestinal complaints, and “pseudoneurology” but not to musculoskeletal complaints.

Versatile application of this apparatus to solid Earth science is demonstrated by elucidating the characteristics of the 660 km discontinuity and formation of the lower mantle. Recently the maximum attainable pressure in Kawai-type apparatus has been extended to 63 GPa by adopting sintered diamond as the anvil material. Therefore, phase equilibrium and melting experiments of Earth materials have been carried out to conditions deep into the lower mantle. The results will substantially advance our understanding of the structure and evolution of the Earth."qwqwEiji Ito

As a lake parameterisation scheme FLake is implemented into the limited-area NWP model COSMO. Results from a numerical experiment with the coupled COSMO-FLake system, including the complete COSMO-model data assimilation cycle, indicate a good performance with respect to the lake surface temperature and to the freeze-up of lakes and the ice break-up. The use of FLake removes a significant overestimation of the lake surface temperature during winter that is typical of the routine COSMO sea surface temperature analysis. Some challenging issues are discussed, such as the development of external-parameter fields and the lake temperature spin-up following a cold start of FLake in an NWP or climate model."qwqwDmitrii Mironov;Heist Ep;Ekaterina Kourzeneva;Bodo Ritter;Natália Schneider;Arkady Terzhevik

Blake was by no means a copious annotator, but the extant volumes reflect the poet's engagement not only with ideas but also with the materiality through which those ideas are communicated. "The Torn Book" shows that the marginalia represent important evidence of Blake-as-reader experiencing the typographical features of books printed using the conventional, moveable-type methods of the day. The annotated volumes are thus key to understanding Blake both as a poet and as a bookmaker himself. Jason Snart is an Assistant Professor of English at the College of DuPage."qwqwJason A Snart

At half-filling, the system exhibits a partially disordered insulating state, in which a collinear antiferromagnetic order on an unfrustrated honeycomb subnetwork coexists with nonmagnetic state at the remaining sites. We find that the carrier doping destabilizes the partially disordered state, resulting in a phase separation to a doped metallic state with different magnetic order. The partially disordered state is restricted to the half-filled insulating case, while its metallic counterpart is obtained as a metastable state in a narrow electron doped region."qwqwSatoru Hayami,Department of Applied Physics, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8656;Masafumi Udagawa,Department of Applied Physics, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8656|||Max-Planck-Institut für Physik komplexer Systeme, Nöthnitzer Straße 38, 01187 Dresden;Yukitoshi Motome,Department of Applied Physics, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-8656

En accord avec la legislation REACH, nous avons utilise ces methodes dans le but de creer des modeles QSAR permettant de predire la toxicite des substances sur trois especes aquatiques : les algues, les daphnies et les poissons. Les modeles crees sont de deux sortes. Nous mettrons en avant la creation de modeles globaux, qui font abstraction de la famille chimique ou du mode d’action (MOA) des substances considerees, et de modeles QSAR specifiques d’un MOA. Enfin, un exemple d’utilisation de ces modeles QSAR est presente. Ces derniers sont utilises dans le but de predire la phrase de risque associee a une molecule."qwqwSylvain Lozano

Among various methods for nanoparticle synthesis, the utilization of microbes is one of the solutions for bioanalysis of biocomponents. Microbes which are non-pathogenic to humans are employed to reduce the metal ions. The objective of the study was to synthesize of inorganic meterials on nano and micro length scale.  Methods: In this work,  Fusarium oxysporum  from wilted tomato plant was selected and silica nanoparticles were synthesized. The silica nanoparticles synthesis characterization was done using UV-spec., FTIR and SEM analysis. The appropriate conditions for silica nanoparticles synthesis optimization and the separation of nanoparticle biosynthetic protein were carried out. Then the efficiency of nanoparticle in DNA protection from enzymatic cleavages and dye decolourization also determined.  Results: The studies showed the confirmation of isolated  F. oxysporum  and the synthesized silica nanoparticles surface plasmon band occurs at 280 nm. In FTIR analysis, the presence of a resonance at ca.1113 cm -1  and absorption bands at ca.1623.62 indicated the amide band in the particle. Conclusions: Thus, fungus mediated silica nanoparticles synthesis could be used in many biological researches."qwqwKannan Marikani,V.H.N.S.N. College (Autonomous), Virudhunagar – 626 001.

The aim of this article is to discuss the pathological features of drug-induced renal disease as diagnosed by kidney biopsy. The literature is reviewed and cases seen by the authors that have a known drug association are analysed. Mechanisms of injury are varied and all renal structures may be affected. The tubulointerstitial compartment is most frequently involved, but glomerular and vascular lesions are seen in a significant proportion of cases.

This could occur by a random selection of molecules for replication or by a process that ensures the replication of each individual molecule in the cell. We have investigated the rate at which mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA molecules labeled with  3 H-thymidine during one round of replication are reselected for a second round of replication. Mouse L cells were labeled with  3 H-thymidine for 2 hr, chased for various periods of time and then labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine for 4 hr immediately before mitochondrial DNA isolation. A constant fraction of  3 H-thymidine-labeled mitochondrial DNA incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine after chase intervals ranging from 1.5–22 hr. This result demonstrates that mitochondrial DNA molecules replicated in a short time interval are randomly selected for later rounds of replication, and that replication of mitochondrial DNA continues throughout the cell cycle in mouse L cells."qwqwDaniel Bogenhagen;David A.

The first is an examination of a public policy, the Queensland Department of Education's Equal Opportunity Policy for Girls and Boys (1981) and the Implementation Guidelines (1988) for that policy within the context of the pedagogical practices of one secondary school. The second purpose is to answer a criticism often levelled at structural theories of education. This criticism centres around the inability of structural theories to account for the real life experiences of teachers and students. Bernstein's (1986) theory of Pedagogic Discourse and Fernandes’ (1988) work on Resistance theory are applied to three levels of educational practice; public policy, school practices and the everyday experiences of a group of female students. Through this analysis, movement towards a more satisfactory explanation of the intersection of gender and education is made."qwqwAnne Diamond,Queensland University of Technology , Australia

In the group of 23 patients responding to treatment with the permanent loss of HBe antigen and HBV-DNA from their serum, there was a significant reduction in hepatic inflammatory activity and none developed cirrhosis. In contrast, inflammatory activity continued in the group of 24 patients that did not respond to therapy, and in the group of 19 patients who received no therapy. Two untreated controls progressed to cirrhosis. Further studies confirmed that in those clearing HBcAg and HBV-DNA from the serum, HBcAg and HBeAg were also lost from the liver. This study demonstrates that, as in natural seroconversion, successful treatment of chronic HBV infection is associated with loss of hepatic as well as serum markers of HBV replication, and is followed by a reduction in hepatic inflammation. Antiviral therapy may prevent progression to cirrhosis in some cases."qwqwM. Gary Brook,Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Free Hospital and Medical School, London U.K.;Lidija M.

oppressed groups. In this chapter, we review the impact of the personal experience of discrimination on the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities. We begin by addressing conceptual and methodological issues facing research on links between discrimination and health. We then review: (1) research that has addressed the impact of the personal experience of discrimination on the health of oppressed groups; (2) what is known about the extent to which people with intellectual disabilities experience personal discrimination; (3) the literature that has attempted to address the impact of the personal experience of discrimination on the health of people with intellectual disabilities; (4) the literature on interventions aimed at reducing the exposure to or impact of discrimination among people with intellectual disabilities.

Capacity to engage in knowledge translation is influenced by factors within the academic context and the interaction of the academic and policy environments. Early and mid-career researchers reported a different set of experiences and pressures to senior researchers. Barriers to knowledge translation reported are largely consistent with prior research. However, this study also emphasised the importance of academic professional identity in research-policy translation. Strategies to enhance research uptake should both address structural barriers and seek to encourage a culture of engagement with public policy."qwqwAlex Collie;Pauline Zardo;Donna Margaret McKenzie;Niki Ellis

In reality, wireless transceivers are considered one of the main consumers of energy in individual sensor nodes of WSNs. The duty cycling technique which puts transceiver module into sleep state for the majority of sensor node's operating time is considered a highly effective method to reduce energy consumption. In this paper we present the use of Wake-on-Radio (WoR) for reduction of used energy and conducted power consumption experiments using CC430-based WSN nodes. The results show promising performance improvement when using WoR in the CC1101 radio transceiver of CC430. Then, an adaptive duty cycle algorithm based on the WoR functionality, which enables sensor nodes to dynamically adjust their WoR duty cycles according to the real-time wireless channel conditions in achieving reduced power consumption, was proposed."qwqwLiming Qiu,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, New Zealand;Kevin I-Kai Wang,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, New Zealand;Zoran Salcic,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, New Zealand

In this article, Pierre Fortin from the University of Quebec at Montreal examines differences in annual work hours on a per capita basis between the United States and Canada. He finds that in 2001 average hours worked was lower in Canada (91 per cent of the U.S. level), while the employment/total population ratio was actually higher in Canada (103 per cent of the U.S. level). With output per hour in Canada 90 per cent of the U.S. level, the overall effect of these three variables was to produce a level of GDP per capita in Canada that was 85 per cent of the U.S. level. He also finds that Ontario in 2001 had enjoyed a higher level of GDP per capita than Quebec (86 per cent versus 77 per cent of the U.S. level) because of its greater average hours worked and higher employment/total population ratio, offset by a slightly lower productivity level."qwqwPierre Fortin

Po tential-dependent anion adsorption-desorption waves via the nonfaradaic current were obtained by means of cyclic voltammetry at Au colloid-modified gold electrodes in the potential range of -200-600 mV. The adsorption sequence in the order of adsorption peak potentials(Epa) is OH-＞citrate3-＞H2PO4-＞Cl-＞SO42-＞ClO4-＞NO3-. Among them, citrate3-exhibited an en tirely irreversible adsorption. A rise in temperature can increase the rates of adsorption-desorp tion and improve the reversibility of the adsorption-desorption of CI-, SO24-, CIO4-, NO3- and H2PO4-. The adsorption peak potentials shifted more negatively for ca. 63 mV as the anion con centrations were increased by a decade factor. The change of pH from 7 to 1 slightly affected the adsorption peak potentials of Cl- and NO3-. Au colloids with a smaller size (16 nm) gave rise to a better reversibility of the adsorption-desorption process and lower adsorption currents. The ex perimental results of citrate ions adsorption on Au colloid surface show that Au colloids with a smaller size prepared by sodium citrate method exhibited a higher stability in the solution in com parison to those with larger sizes because of its higher ratio of charge/mass. In other words, the smaller gold nanoparticles are covered with citrate ions monolayer that can also be formed at larg er gold nanoparticles by means of electrochemical scan."qwqwHu;Xiaoya

Kamgar-Parsi applies iterative closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm into underwater gravity matching, in which simplex algorithm is used to estimate the optimal trace of vehicle. However, simplex algorithm is usually convergent to the local optimization so that there is mismatching or even diverging.

At present, the well used mismatching judgment rule, M/N method, has several shortcomings, including matching several times before location, much large matching error, and difficult to decide parameters. In this paper, the rule of mismatching judgment for ICCP is established by probability data association filter (PDAF). Simulation shows that PDAF improves the convergence and precision compared with the ICCP algorithm without mismatching judgment, and its mismatching probability decreases 35 percent compared with M/N method. The PDAF method for mismatching judgment increases the ICCPpsilas precision and stabilization."qwqwYong Yang,Sch. of Astronaut., Beihang Univ., Beijing;Kedong Wang,Sch. of Astronaut., Beihang Univ., Beijing

The SSN powder compacts showed improved densification and enhanced grain growth. SRBSN materials were fabricated in the microwave with a one-step process using cost-effective raw materials. The SRBSN materials had properties appropriate for structural applications. Observed increases in fracture toughness for the microwave processed SRBSN materials were attributable to enhanced elongated grain growth."qwqwT.N. Tiegs,Oak Ridge National Laboratory, P.O.

The basic operation algorithms of modern milking machines have been considered in the paper. Based on the conducted experimental studies it has been estimated that the distribution of duration for preparing animals for milking equals to a chi-square distribution, the distribution of the milking time when employing milking machines with no milking control function and the distribution of random milking time intervals using the milking control function equals to a gamma distribution.A statistical model of a mechanical milking duration using a milking robot, a milking machine without the milking control function, a milking machine with the milking control function, which takes into account the minimum operation duration of a milking machine, has been developed"qwqwВ.

However, in Kenya little is known on the level of agrobiodiversity of these mixed farms and its contribution to food and nutrition security. A case study was conducted to assess food plant and livestock diversity and to identify the biophysical and socioeconomic factors influencing food plant diversity in 30 smallholder farms in Western Kenya. The survey identified six livestock species and 59 food plant species. Higher food plant species richness was found on farms managed by wealthier households and older household heads. However, households with high on-farm food plant richness and diversity were not more food secure than households managing species-poor farms. The nonsignificant relationship between food security and agrobiodiversity during the time of this case study may have resulted from the fact that t..."qwqwMary Ng’endo,School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK;Gudrun B.

In the absence of post program information, the theory of planned behavior is used to assess participants’ main travel mode intentions as well as their intention to purchase a new or used vehicle following program participation. A subset of program participants (2009-2011; n=9070, 22%) filled an optional survey about their future vehicle purchase and travel intentions, as well as reasons for entering the program. Age, gender, household income, incentive chosen, distance travelled in previous year and perceived access to public transit were used as independent variables in logistic and multinomial logistic regressions. Car purchase intention and mainly travelling by vehicle was associated with greater distance travelled. Higher income participants were more likely to purchase new vehicles and lower income population more likely to purchase used vehicles or to refrain from any purchase. Intentions to use alternative travel modes were each associated with different sociodemographic characteristics and psychosocial factors. There was no association between chosen incentive and future travel intentions. Early vehicle retirement programs offer a promising incentive-based opportunity to influence mode shift. A post program survey is required to better understand actual long-term mode shift associated with program."qwqwUgo Lachapelle

Robert Barany was one of the first clinicians to assess vestibular function systematically in patients. He developed standard caloric, rotational, and pointing tests and was the first to describe benign paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Barany began his career working in the otology clinic of Adam Politzer at the University of Vienna. He received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1916 for his work on the mechanism of the caloric reaction. However, in the aftermath of the First World War and the controversy surrounding his selection for the Nobel Prize, Barany left Vienna for Uppsala, Sweden, where he spent the last 20 years of his life in relative isolation."qwqwRobert W.

This increased the ethanol productivity of the repeated batch system with 5% w/v of immobilized glucoamylase almost 2.1 times (7.2 g l−1 h−1) compared to free enzyme–free microorganism system (3.5 g l−1 h−1). The continuous SSF with the immobilized glucoamylase (11.5% w/v) tested for 15 days had productivity 10 g l−1 h−1, which is comparable to continuous experiments on semi-defined glucose medium (10 g l−1 h−1).

However, it is opposite in most climate models. It is also evident that there exists a cold bias in tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperature (SST) and a warm bias in southeastern Pacific (SEP) SST. In this study, the influences of TNA and SEP SSTs on the double-ITCZ bias are investigated by prescribing the observed SST in these regions in the NCAR CESM1. Results show that when TNA SST is prescribed, the northern ITCZ is substantially enhanced and the southern ITCZ is moderately reduced, although the SST response in these regions is small. When the SEP SST is prescribed, the southern ITCZ is reduced considerably. When both TNA and SEP SSTs are prescribed, the double-ITCZ bias is reduced by ~68%. Moisture budget analysis suggests that dynamics, mainly the low-level convergence change, determines the above precipitation changes. Based on a mixed layer mo..."qwqwFengfei Song;Guang J. Zhang

Methods and Results: Genus determination was made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and fatty acid methyl ester profiling. Genetic diversity was investigated by repetitive sequence genetic PCR fingerprinting. Several onion isolates were similar to clinical isolates but others were diverse. Some environmental isolates were possibly synonymous with B. cepacia and B. gladioli but most from woodland rhizospheres were distinct and clustered together. The 16S rRNA genes of representatives from these clusters were PCR amplified, sequenced and phylogenetically compared with all known Burkholderia and related species. This revealed that the rhizospheric isolates had closest affinity with Burkholderia spp. with known bioremediative and biocontrol capabilities and were unrelated to taxa comprising plant or human pathogenic strains. Conclusions: All of the analyses investigated revealed that environmental and onion isolates of B. cepacia complex bacteria are genetically diverse but that woodland rhizospheric isolates are related to each other and unrelated to plant or human pathogenic strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: Woodland rhizospheric isolates of B. cepacia are potentially good candidates for use in bioremediation and biocontrol, as they appear distinct from plant or human pathogenic strains."qwqwJ.

Because of a series of structural reforms, the rural economy has undergone profound changes since 1979; the rapid growth of the nonfarm sector is one of the changes. In promoting the nonfarm sector, two development models have been followed: the development of publicly owned nonfarm industries and the development of privately owned nonfarm industries in rural areas. The paper reaches the following conclusions. System reform plays an important role in developing the rural economy. However, such reforms must be welcomed by the rural people, must support their initiatives, and must promote the growth of the rural economy. Industrialization strategy should be conducive to increased rural income and to the coordinated development of both agriculture and industry. In promoting the growth of the rural nonfarm sector, no uniformity of development should be demanded and no restrictions or bans applied. Lastly the development of the nonfarm sector will create a host of problems which will need serious attention, but which can be solved gradually."qwqwDong Fureng

In the network, a source delivers message to its destination by using other nodes as relays. Each hop employs decode-and-forward (DF) with automatic repeat request (ARQ). Two scenarios are considered: one is a noise-limited environment, and the other is an interference-limited environment. The average end-to-end delays of both operation environment are derived as closed-form expressions of a number of parameters, such as the source-destination distance, the number of hops, the transmission and noise power, etc. With the analytical results, the optimum numbers of hops that can minimize the end-to-end delays of both scenarios are identified."qwqwDali Hu,School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China;Jingxian Wu,Dept. of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, 72701, U.S.A.;Pingzhi Fan,School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China

Crude extract that against  Enterococcus faecalis  planktonic and biofilm. Method Crude extracts from Curcuma were extracted by 95% ethanol. The antibacterial activity against  Enterococcus faecalis  was carried out by agar disc diffusion assay and determined both MIC and MBC of crude extracts against  Enterococcus faecalis  planktonic and biofilm by broth dilution assay compared to chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2 % w/v). Result The MIC and MBC of the crude extracts against  Enterococcus faecalis  planktonic were   25 mg/ml and  50 mg/ml, respectively, whereas those of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate were 0.031 mg/ml and 0.063 mg/ml, respectively. The crude extract was able to totally inhibit growth of  Enterococcuc faecalis  biofilms at concentration of 300 mg/ml. In addition, the crude extracts inhibited  Enterococcus   faecalis  established biofilm at the minimal concentration of 37.5 mg/ml, however the eradication of established  Enterococcus   faecalis  biofilm was not seen at the highest concentration used in this study. Conclusion The crude extracts have antibacterial activity against  Enterococcus faecalis  both planktonic and biofilm. However, the concentration that can inhibit  Enterococcus faecalis  biofilm is higher than planktonic forms.

use of research evidence in clinical practice. However, conceptual clarity about what exactly comprises “context” is lacking. The purpose of this research program is to develop, refine, and validate a framework that identifies the key domains of context (and their features) that can facilitate or hinder (1) healthcare professionals’ use of evidence in clinical practice and (2) the effectiveness of implementation interventions."qwqwJanet E Squires,School of Nursing, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada|||Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada;Ian D.

Modelling, categorizing, establishing structural correlations are integral parts of grammatical processes. The possibility of demonstrating word-formation forms in generalized modelled state, determining their place and meaning in the modelled structure of the language gives evidence of grammatical indication of word-formation. Word-formation units take part in categorizing reality above all by way of distributing to parts of speech. Among categories there are subcategories. Separate word-formation models correlate. As far as the dynamic aspect of word-formation is concerned the functioning models provide patterns for creating new derivatives."qwqwЛ. Д. Исакова

We present data from a European cystic fibrosis registry that is dedicated to collection of demographic data, and assess whether the resources available in countries with and without European Union (EU) membership affects care and survival of patients.  Methods  Data for demographic indicators—age, age at diagnosis, sex, and genotype—for patients with cystic fibrosis from 35 European countries were combined, and used to establish the differences in demographic indicators between EU and non-EU countries. EU membership status in 2003 was used to divide countries. We modelled demographic indicators of EU countries on non-EU countries to estimate the size of the cystic fibrosis population if non-EU countries had had the same resources available for patients as did EU countries.  Findings  Data were gathered for 29 025 patients, who had a median age of 16·3 years (IQR 8·9–24·8), with a difference of 4·9 years (95% CI 4·4–5·1; p  Interpretation  Future studies need to establish the reasons for the lower proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis in non-EU countries than in EU countries, such as underdiagnosis and premature childhood mortality.

The electrocatalytic properties of the sputtered Pt films toward the oxygen reduction reaction were investigated in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4  solution and in a hydrogen PEM fuel cell. The catalyst with ultralow Pt loading of 22 μg cm −2  deposited on a 33 A thick Ti sublayer is robust, mechanically stable, possesses highly developed surface area and improved catalytic efficiency. Its performance as a MEA cathode in a single hydrogen PEM fuel cell (577 mA cm −2  at 0.4 V cell voltages and a maximum power of 0.954 W) proved to be much superior compared to that of MEA with the same cathode Pt loading but without Ti sublayer (173 mA cm −2  at 0.4 V, 0.231 W, respectively)."qwqwOsman Öztürk,Nanotechnology Research Center, Gebze Institute of Technology, 41400 Kocaeli, Turkey;Oguz Kaan Ozdemir,Nanotechnology Research Center, Gebze Institute of Technology, 41400 Kocaeli, Turkey;Isılay Ulusoy,Nanotechnology Research Center, Gebze Institute of Technology, 41400 Kocaeli, Turkey;Ali Sems Ahsen,Nanotechnology Research Center, Gebze Institute of Technology, 41400 Kocaeli, Turkey;E.

importance and therapeutic value of stem cells in lymphangiogenesis are poorly understood. We evaluated the potential of human and murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to acquire a lymphatic phenotype in vitro and to enhance lymphatic regeneration in vivo. Methods and Results—We assessed the lymphendothelial differentiation of human and murine MSCs after induction with supernatant derived from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, isolated lymphatic endothelial cells, and purified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C in vitro. We used human or murine progenitor MSC lines and then characterized the lymphatic phenotype by morphology, migratory capacity, and the expression of lymphatic markers such as Prox-1, podoplanin, Lyve-1, VEGF receptor-2, and VEGF receptor-3. Using a murine lymphatic edema model, we assessed the potential of these cells to form a functional lymphatic vasculature in vivo after injection of syngeneic MSCs. Incubation with supernatant from lymphatic endothelial cells induced an endothelium-like morphology and the expression of lymphendothelial markers in both human and murine MSCs in vitro. MSCs showed migratory activity along a VEGF-C gradient, which was enhanced by VEGF-C conditioning. In vivo, the local application of MSCs resulted in a significant decrease in edema formation (20.1%; P0.01 versus untreated tails) after 3 weekly cell injections and restored the drainage of intradermally injected methylene blue after 7 weekly injections. Conclusions—MSCs were capable of expressing a lymphatic phenotype when exposed to lymph-inductive media and purified VEGF-C. Migratory activity toward VEGF-C in vitro suggests homing capability in vivo. Restoration of lymphatic drainage after injection of MSCs in a lymphedema model indicates that MSCs play a role in lymphatic regeneration. The potential clinical application of MSC in wound healing and reduction of lymphatic edema warrants further research.

The pore size of the CCBs was tuned by using different nanoparticles. The CCBs were then coated with cadmium telluride quantum dots and zinc(II) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin for the purpose of optical sensing. Ammonia causes the color of the sensor to change from green to red. The method has a dynamic range of 0–2500 ppm, good reversibility, and is not sensitive to humidity. The limit of detection is 7 ppm. The sensor has the advantage of a porous microcarrier structure and that pore sizes can be well controlled and thus can fulfill various demands in gas detection."qwqwHua Xu,State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, People’s Republic of China;Maochun Zhang,State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, People’s Republic of China;Haibo Ding,State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, People’s Republic of China;Zhuoying Xie,State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, People’s Republic of China

We use statistical mechanics to analyze the competition that occurs among all susceptible Z-forming regions at thermodynamic equilibrium in a superhelically stressed DNA of specified sequence. This method, which we call SIBZ, is similar to the SIDD algorithm that was previously developed to analyze superhelical duplex destabilization. A state of the system is determined by assigning to each base pair either the B- or the Z-conformation, accounting for the dinucleotide repeat unit of Z-DNA. The free energy of a state is comprised of the nucleation energy, the sequence-dependent B-Z transition energy, and the energy associated with the residual superhelicity remaining after the change of twist due to transition. Using this information, SIBZ calculates the equilibrium B-Z transition probability of each base pair in the sequence. This can be done at any physiologically reasonable level of negative superhelicity. We use SIBZ to analyze a variety of representative genomic DNA sequences. We show that the dominant Z-DNA forming regions in a sequence can compete in highly complex ways as the superhelicity level changes. Despite having no tunable parameters, the predictions of SIBZ agree precisely with experimental results, both for the onset of transition in plasmids containing introduced Z-forming sequences and for the locations of Z-forming regions in genomic sequences. We calculate the transition profiles of 5 kb regions taken from each of 12,841 mouse genes and centered on the transcription start site (TSS). We find a substantial increase in the frequency of Z-forming regions immediately upstream from the TSS. The approach developed here has the potential to illuminate the occurrence of Z-form regions in vivo, and the possible roles this transition may play in biological processes."qwqwDina Zhabinskaya,UC Davis Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis California, United States of America;Craig J.

The method used to study this problem is based on the integral over the time of the undesired perturbing forces. This integral measures the change of velocity caused by the perturbation forces acting on the satellite, so mapping orbits that are less perturbed, which generates good candidates for orbits that requires low fuel consumption for station-keeping maneuvers. The integral over the time depends only on the orbit of the spacecraft and the dynamical system considered. The type of engine and the control technique applied to the spacecraft are not considered to search for those orbits. It can be a good strategy to be applied for a first mapping of orbits. For this search, it is analyzed the integral of orbits with different values of the Keplerian elements in order to find the best ones with respect to this criterion. The perturbations considered are the ones caused by the third body, which includes the Sun and the Moon, and the J2 term of the geopotential. The results presented here show numerical simulations to obtain the integral of those perturbing forces for different orbits. The GPS and the Molniya constellations are used as examples for those calculations."qwqwThais Carneiro Oliveira,Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), Engenharia e Tecnologia Espaciais, Mecânica Espacial e Controle, Brazil;Antonio F.

The prediction method features ﬁve empirical criteria according to minimum pressure, laminar separation, Michel, van Driest & Blumer and Arnal, Habiballah & Delcourt (AHD). The criteria’s equations will be brieﬂy summarized. The prediction method’s algorithm and it’s implementation into the DLR’s structured ﬂow solver FLOWer will be described. Validation has been carried out for the Somer’s airfoil (M∞ = 0.3, α = −5◦ , 15◦) as well as the CAST10 airfoil (M∞ = 0.73, α = −0.25◦ ). A veriﬁcation of the implemented method has been done using the ONERA 7A rotor hover test case. Finally, the method is applied to a recent rotor geometry in hover, representing an industrial application case."qwqwC. C. Heister

Between March 1992 and September 1996, we attempted to treat 102 patients with endoscopic treatment for pharyngoesophageal diverticula. In 98 patients, the endoscopic surgery was successfully completed. Conversion to open surgery was required in 4 patients (3.92%). One cartridge of staples in 16 patients (16.32%), 2 cartridges in 78 patients (79.59%), and 3 cartridges in 4 patients (4.08%) were used, according to the size of the diverticulum; the median duration of the procedure was 20 minutes (10 to 60 minutes). No postoperative morbidity or mortality was recorded. Oral feeding was started following radiologic control after a median of 2 days; the median hospital stay was 4 days. The median follow-up is 16 months (1 to 45 months). Four patients operated on before the introduction of the modified stapler showed a persistent diverticular pouch: 3 underwent repeat endoscopic operation, and 1 underwent conventional open surgery. All treated patients are asymptomatic. Manometric study performed in 15 patients showed a significant reduction of basal upper esophageal sphincter pressure compared to preoperative data (48.30±21.74 versus 29.38 ±5.68 mm Hg; p <.01). We therefore recommend endoscopic diverticulotomy, considering that the procedure is relatively safe and effective, with minimal patient discomfort, and the results are equal to those of the external approach. This procedure offers the advantages of short hospitalization, rapid convalescence, brief operative time, absence of skin incision, predictable resolution of symptoms, and reduced morbidity."qwqwSurendra Narne,Padua, Italy;Cesare Cutrone,Padua, Italy;B.

It covers numerous intelligent computing methodologies and algorithms used in CI research. The book first focuses on neural networks, including common artificial neural networks; neural networks based on data classification, data association, and data conceptualization; and real-world applications of neural networks. It then discusses fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules, applications of fuzzy systems, and different types of fused neuro-fuzzy systems, before providing MATLAB illustrations of ANFIS, classification and regression trees, fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms, fuzzy ART map, and TakagiSugeno inference systems. The authors also describe the history, advantages, and disadvantages of evolutionary computation and include solved MATLAB programs to illustrate the implementation of evolutionary computation in various problems. After exploring the operators and parameters of genetic algorithms, they cover the steps and MATLAB routines of genetic programming. The final chapter introduces swarm intelligence and its applications, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Full of worked examples and end-of-chapter questions, this comprehensive book explains how to use MATLAB to implement CI techniques for the solution of biological problems. It will help readers with their work on evolution dynamics, self-organization, natural and artificial morphogenesis, emergent collective behaviors, swarm intelligence, evolutionary strategies, genetic programming, and the evolution of social behaviors."qwqwS.

This study has assessed the empirical evidence for such a claim in the case of Bangladesh by evaluating unique employer-employee matched labor market data. The analysis is based on data collected from 6,981 workers in 500 formal sector firms in Bangladesh's five largest formal economic sectors. Using ordinary least squares and firm fixed-effect models, the study assesses correlations between wages and the so-called"big five"personality traits, and augments the analysis with the latent personality scores captured by the Rasch model. Comparing the ordinary least squares and fixed-effect models reveals statistically significant correlations between personality traits and wages, within and across firms. The results appear to indicate that non-cognitive skills are correlated with a worker's likelihood of achieving success in the labor market. Although many of the findings are consistent with the literature, the analysis reveals specific patterns that appear to be unique to Bangladesh, including a positive correlation between ?emotional stability? and wages and a negative correlation between"grit"and wages, especially among manufacturing workers. Differences across firms could indicate that firms that offer higher wages may tend to attract workers with distinct types of non-cognitive skills, whereas differences within firms may indicate that variations in non-cognitive skills are associated with disparities in firm-level wage structures. Correlations between wages and personality traits are more prominent among large firms than among small or medium-sized firms."qwqwSamik Adhikari;Shinsaku Nomura

The benzodithiol group is a versatile and chameleonic group that can be further functionalized before fluorination, giving customized and tailored useful synthetic strategies. As an example of the application of this facile strategy, the effective enantioselective synthesis of difluoroarundic acid is described. All you need is fluor!

Accurate calculation of this axial force is very important in selection of bearing and design of balancing pistons. In this paper, an experimental study of the axial force on the twin-screw compressor rotors was conducted. The variations of the axial force under different operating conditions were investigated. Furthermore, the axial force was also calculated by employing the mean pressure model and sector pressure model, and was compared with that of the experimental results. It was concluded that the sector pressure model is more accurate in predicting the axial force on the rotors in comparison with that of the mean pressure model. However, the mean pressure model was more accurate under operating conditions with large built-in volume ratio. Moreover, the axial force on the rotor end face was found to have larger influence than that on the rotor helical surface."qwqwFeng Hou,School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China;Zhaorui Zhao,School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China;Zhiqiang Yu,Yantai Moon Corporation, Yantai 264000, China;Ziwen Xing,School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China

Struktur Koneksi Matematis Siswa Kelas X pada Materi Sistem Persamaan Linier. Tesis, Program Studi Pendidikan Matematika, Pascasarjana, Universitas Negeri Malang. Pembimbing: (I) Dr. Edy Bambang Irawan, M. Pd, ( II ) Dr. Hery Susanto, M.Si       Kunci: Struktur Koneksi Matematis, SPL   Koneksi matematis merupakan bagian penting yang harus mendapatkan penekanan di setiap jenjang pendidikan karena dengan koneksi matematis pembelajaran akan bermakna dan optimal dalam pemikiran siswa. Menurut NCTM (2000) koneksi matematis adalah hubungan antar konsep dalam satu    topik yang sama, serta hubungan antar materi dalam topik tertentu dengan materi dalam topik lainnya dalam matematika. Penelitian ini mengkaji struktur koneksi matematis siswa dalam    menyesleaikan soal sistem persamaan linier dengan memberikan lembar tugas individu dan melakukan wawancara kepada subyek. Struktur koneksi matematis dikaji dengan mengkaitkan dengan    indikator koneksi matematis yaitu: (1) mengenal dan menggunakan hubungan diantara ide-ide matematis, dan (2) memahami ide matematis yang saling berhubungan dan membangun satu sama lain untuk menghasilkan keseluruhan yang koheren.   Pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pendekatan kualitatif dengan jenis penelitian deskriptif.    Subjek penelitian adalah siswa kelas X SMA Negeri 2 Batu yang telah mempelajari materi sistem persamaan linier. Pengambilan data dilakukan dengan meminta 3 siswa mengerjakan    lembar tugas individu dan melakukan wawancara kepada ketiga subyek penelitian. Subjek 1 (S1) adalah siswa berkemampuan matematis tinggi, subjek 2 (S2) adalah subjek berkemampuan matematis sedang dan subjek 3 (S3) adalah subjek berkemampuan matematis rendah.   Hasil penelitian menemukan bahwa struktur koneksi yang dimiliki S1 pada soal I dan II telah memenuhi indikator koneksi matematis yaitu: (1) mengenal dan menggunakan hubungan diantara ide-ide matematika, dan (2) memahami ide matematis yang saling berhubungan dan membangun satu sama lain untuk menghasilkan keseluruhan yang koheren. Struktur koneksi matematis S2 pada soal I memenuhi indikator koneksi yaitu: (1) mengenal dan menggunakan hubungan diantara ide-ide matematika, dan (2) memahami ide matematis yang saling berhubungan dan membangun satu sama lain untuk menghasilkan keseluruhan yang koheren. Untuk soal II struktur koneksi S2 memenuhi indikator koneksi yaitu mengenal ide-ide matematis. Struktur koneksi    S3 dalam menentukan solusi SPL secara aljabar memenuhi indikator koneksi yaitu: (1) mengenal dan menggunakan hubungan diantara ide-ide matematika. Untuk soal II, S3 memenuhi indikator koneksi mengenal ide-ide matematis.

Isolation of  S. typhi  by culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but the positive cases are very less, time consuming and expensive, so the best alternative is Widal test. Widal test can be used as a diagnostic tool if we know the baseline titres in a particular community. Objective: To re-evaluate the baseline Widal titres in apparently healthy children in and around Davangere, and to find the significance of 1:160 titres in Widal test.   Methods:  Cross sectional study was done on 250 children. Tube agglutination test was done on 112 healthy and 138 children with minor nontyphoidal illness. Titres were studied in relation to age, sex, nutritional status and healthy children to minor nontyphoidal illness.   Results:  Out of 112 healthy children, 52.7% had titres less than 1: 20, 25% had 1:20, 18.8% had 1:40 and 3.6% had a titre level of 1:80 for ‘O’ antigen of  S. typhi . 63% children had a titre of less than 1: 20, 21.4% had 1:20, 8% for 1:40 and 7.1% had a titre of 1:80 for ‘H’ antigen of  S. typhi . For ‘H’ antigen of  S. paratyphi  A the titres for less than 1:20 were 83%, 8% cases had a titre of 1:20 and 4.5% cases had titre levels of 1:40 and 1:80. No children had a titre value of ≥1:160 for both  S. typhi  and  paratyphi  A in the healthy children group.   Conclusions:  The baseline titres of healthy children in all the age groups and both sex is ≤ 1:80 for ‘O’ and ‘H’ antigen of  S. typhi  and ‘H’ antigen of  S. paratyphi  A."qwqwH Ramesh,Department of Pediatrics, J J M Medical College, Davanagere, Karnataka, India;Nagesh Bp,Department of Pediatrics, J J M Medical College, Davanagere, Karnataka, India;Sandeep Karanam,Department of Pediatrics, J J M Medical College, Davanagere, Karnataka, India;Sankeerth Yellinedi,Department of Pediatrics, J J M Medical College, Davanagere, Karnataka, India;P S Suresh Babu,Department of Pediatrics, J J M Medical College, Davanagere, Karnataka, India

Since its high space resolution, this source is the kernel in such scientific researches and applications as biomedicine, biochemical dynamics, industrial nondestructive examination and detection x-ray microscopy and micro-CT. The electron emission system is the key part of the x-ray tube, it includes the thermal cathode and the focusing system. The cathode provides free electrons and the focusing system helps to constitute the focusing field.

Tapering of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with high air-fill fractions has proven an effective way of extending the spectra into the deep-blue 1-4. This facilitates the ideal combination of (1) an initial fiber section to allow a pulse break-up in the vicinity of the zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW) and an efficient energy transfer into the visible, and (2) a subsequent fiber section with group-velocity match (GVM) from the long wavelength spectral edge to wavelengths in the deep-blue or even UV. Previous reports on blue-extended SC generation were typically achieved in tapered PCFs where the airhole structure was preserved 1-4, i.e. the relative hole-size constant. However, such PCFs with high air-fill fractions are inevitably (highly) multi moded at the pump, which complicates coupling and interfacing. In 5 this was overcome by increasing the air-hole size in a short section of a single mode PCF using a post processing technique, but only to enhance the visible power. Here we present the first high-power SC generation into the deep-blue in a single mode PCF with varying hole-size and pitch fabricated directly at the draw-tower."qwqwS. T.

In order to maintain a stable self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) interaction, the straightness and overlap of the axes to within $3text{ }text{ }ensuremath{mu}mathrm{m}$ between the electron beams and the radiated x rays for an undulator section of about 100 m length is necessary. This straightness means relative alignment to an experimental target sample. Furthermore, a temporal stability of 30 fs in order to maintain a constant peak beam current is also necessary to conduct stable SASE lasing. The monitor system was developed to satisfy these spatial and temporal stability and resolution criteria. The system comprises spatial monitors, such as cavity-type beam-position monitors and screen monitors, as well as temporal measurement instruments, such as current monitors, waveguide spectrometers, coherent synchrotron-radiation detectors, a streak camera, and an rf deflector. Commissioning of SACLA started from March 2011, and the monitors performed sufficient roles to tune the beams for lasing. The achieved overall performances of the system, including data acquisition, are: the beam position monitor has a spatial resolution of 600 nm in rms; the bunch-length monitors show ability to observe bunch lengths from 1 ns in an injector with velocity bunching to less than 30 fs after three-stage bunch compressors. The less than $3text{ }text{ }ensuremath{mu}mathrm{m}$ spatial resolution of the screen monitor was also confirmed during practical beam operation. Owing to these fulfilled performances, such as the high spatial and temporal resolutions, stable lasing of SACLA has been achieved."qwqwYuji Otake,RIKEN, SPring-8 Center, XFEL Research and Development Division, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo, 679-5148, Japan|||JASRI, XFEL Division, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo, 679-5198, Japan;H.

studies, involving postgraduates in both regular and special education, analyzed the agreement between parents' and postgraduates' responses on postschool status. High agreement percentages and strong Cohen Kappas were obtained for the variables of attending postsecondary school, employment status, type of residence, marital status, and number of children. Low agreement rates and weak Kappas were obtained for the variables of salary level, hours worked, and medical benefits received. Results indicate caution in the use of data obtained from parents in the latter areas."qwqwPhyllis Levine,University of Washington;Eugene Edgar,University of Washington

This behaviour is contrasted with that in a heated rotating annulus. Generally, for both systems, the ratio of the flow angular velocities to the system boundary's (angular velocity ratios) are found, even close to boundaries, not equal to unity. However, for the cavity, the angular velocity ratio tends to unity in the vicinity of the throughflow air. Both systems exhibit similar radial distributions of averaged temporal velocity gradient components. Most unsteadiness is found to correspond to regions of high tangential velocity gradients. As a result of the flow drift, these spatial gradients are converted to temporal gradients. The cavity heat transfer is shown to vary almost as much in the tangential direction as in the radial. For the present flows, computations suggest judicious coordinate system angular velocity choices may reduce demands on both convective term treatments and computer resources."qwqwGdv Davis;E.

A novel map transformation framework (MTF) is proposed in this paper. With MTF, a feature map or a topological map can be converted into a standard topological map on which many graph-search algorithms suitable for CPP can be employed to carry out path planning for multiple target search. Theoretical analysis proves that the route generated by this approach is optimal. Both simulation results and experiments indicate that the MTF-based algorithm is better than several other target-search algorithms. © 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

But existing DRM schemes for multimedia service are not fit for H.264 SE system. Because the amount of transmitted multimedia data is changed considering network environment and terminal equipments' performance by the system, but in the existing DRM schemes, the amount of handled multimedia data are not variable according to network environment and terminal equipments' performance. In this paper, an information security scheme combined video watermarking and encryption is presented for H.264 SE. Amount of watermarks and embedding positions are calculated by the frame number of enhancement layers which are created according to the state of networks and terminal equipments. In order to minimize delayed time by video watermarking and encryption, the video data are watermarked and encrypted in the H.264 SE compression process. In the experimental results, we confirmed that proposed scheme is robust against video compression, general signal processing and geometric processing."qwqwWon-Jei Kim;Teak-Young Seung;Suk-Hwan Lee;Ki-Ryong Kwon

Normally the chromosomal status of patients is detected by karyotyping of up to 20 metaphase spreads, where low-grade mosaicism may be missed. This study was carried out to test whether Klinefelter patients with 47, XXY karyotype with few characteristic features of KFS may harbour normal 46,XY cell line. We analysed 150 well-spread G-banded metaphases in each Klinefelter patient(n-20). RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 4 patients had (5-12%) normal 46,XY cell line. This had not been identified on analyzing 20 metaphase spreads. CONCLUSIONS: These result suggests that 47,XXY patients with presence of XY cell line may have a higher probability of finding germ cells and isolated foci of spermatogenesis in the semeniferous tubules. This is a good diagnostic and prognostic marker for ART. Therefore infertile Klinefelter patients with low-grade mosaicism with 46, XY normal cell line, are good candidates for for ART/ICSI but in such cases if fertilization occurs it should be followed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)."qwqwM.

Pulsations levitate material from the stellar surface and provide density enhancements and shocks, which can encourage dust formation and re-processing. The dust composition depends on the atmospheric chemistry (abundance of carbon relative to oxygen), which is altered by dredging up newly formed carbon to the surface of the star. I will briefly review the current status of models that include AGB mass loss and relate them to recent observations of AGB stars from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) Spitzer surveys of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, including measures of the total dust input to the interstellar medium from AGB stars.

The finding of IgA antibodies to EBV-capsid antigen (VCA) and to early antigen (EA) showed a high degree of correlation for patients with NPC, thereby confirming previous reports. In addition, when considered together, IgA anti-VCA and IgG anti-EA antibody titres appeared to distinguish NPC-patients from those in control populations.  Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas with lymphoid cellular infiltrations showed the highest frequency of association with positive EBV serological tests."qwqwRoberto Cevenini,The Institute of Microbiology, University of Bologna, Ospedale S.

It leads up to the automatic terrain model system. It explains quickly the several systems that were considered and why the printed circuit system was chosen. It mentions the fact that the information is stored on magnetic tape and utilized to carve a three-dimensional terrain model, and then goes into detail as to the greater information that this particular system can provide automatically that cannot be done except through extensive hand calculation with the other systems."qwqwS.

However, a user requires not only relevant but also fresh information. We have developed a method for adjusting the ranking of search engine results from the point of view of page freshness and relevance. It uses an algorithm that post-processes search engine results based on the changed contents of the pages. By analyzing archived versions of web pages we estimate temporal qualities of pages, that is, general freshness and relevance of the page to the query topic over certain time frames. For the top quality web pages, their content differences between past snapshots of the pages indexed by a search engine and their present versions are analyzed. Basing on these differences the algorithm assigns new ranks to the web pages without the need to maintain a constantly updated index of web documents."qwqwAdam Jatowt;Yukiko Kawai;Katsumi Tanaka

How Women Have Betrayed Women, negatively evaluates the gender variant of feminism. According to Sommers, the left wing feminism betrayed the true matters of women and intensified hostility between women and men. Unfortunately, the libertarian feminism advocate’s disquisition is no deep and profound critique of the background of left-wing feministic movement but only a partial description of the environment of American radical feminists. Although authentic feminism should make use of theoretical findings of liberal traditions – Hoff Sommers doesn’t present any comprehensive analysis of the potential of libertarian thought in that matter."qwqwKatarzyna Guczalska,University of Economics in Krakow, Poland

The method is based on the inclusion of the total contribution of π and σ electrons to the spectra of collective oscillations in the molecules. This allows one to consider fullerene molecules with an arbitrary symmetry and arbitrary substituents. A comparative analysis of the experimental curves obtained for resonance electron capture and the results of numerical simulations for C60, C70, and C76 molecules has demonstrated that not only the main maxima but also the ranges of the formation of negative ions coincide."qwqwR.

Hence, the success of two large-leaved palmettos in peninsular Florida’s seasonally xeric, nutrient-impoverished uplands seems anomalous, given that their leaves are orders of magnitude larger than the leaves of sympatric species. An examination of a 16-yr data set of leaf traits and leaf life spans across four vegetative associations differing in available light showed that Serenoa repens and Sabal etonia had low rates of leaf production coupled with long leaf life spans reaching 3.5 yr in heavily shaded plants. The adaptation of these palmettos to xeric, nutrient-poor habitats has generated dwarf statures, diminished leaf sizes and numbers, increased leaf life spans, and reduced rates of leaf production relative to other palms and congeners of more mesic sites. Leaf and petiole size, plant leaf canopy area, and leaf life span increased in both palmettos with decreasing available light, helping to compensate for reduced photosynthetic rates under shaded conditions and for the high leaf construction costs of the large, thick palmetto leaves. Large leaf size in these palmettos, likely due to phylogenetic conservatism, is compensated by other leaf traits (e.g., heavily cutinized epidermises, thick laminas) that increase survival in seasonally xeric, nutrient-impoverished environments."qwqwWarren G.

The model calculates the partial molar volume of dissolved CO 2  from the density of saturated binary, H 2 O–CO 2 , solution and the corresponding mole fraction of dissolved CO 2 . The density of the saturated binary solution is determined as a function of temperature and pressure from a regression of experimental data. The mole fraction of dissolved CO 2  is obtained from the Redlich–Kwong equation of state. The partial molar volume of CO 2  obtained in his manner is then made to coincide with one solution branch of the Redlich–Kwong equation while retaining the other solution branch associated with the molar volume of the gas phase. This allows the simultaneous calculation of both the gas and the liquid molar volume with a single equation of state. The density of the saturated ternary solution predicted by the new model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data.

We now show that Irinophore C™ is also effective against patient derived xenografts (PDX) of colon cancer, and examine the kinetics of vascular normalization in the HT-29 tumor model and assess how these changes might be used with 5-FU sequentially.#R##N#Materials and methods#R##N#Rag2M mice bearing HT-29 tumors were treated with IrC™ (25 mg/kg; Q7D × 3) for up to three weeks. Groups of tumors were harvested for analysis at 7, 14 and 21 days after the start of treatment. Drug and lipid levels in the tumor were evaluated using HPLC and scintillation counts, respectively. Changes in tumor morphology (H&E), vasculature (CD31), perfusion (Hoechst 33342) and apoptosis (TUNEL) were quantified using microscopy. The accumulation of a second drug (14C-5-FU, 40 mg/kg) given 3 h before sacrifice was determined using liquid scintillation. The efficacy of IrC™ (Q7D × 3) followed by 5-FU treatment (Q7D × 3) was assessed in mice bearing established HT-29 tumors. The efficacy of IrC™ was also evaluated in primary human colorectal tumors grown orthotopically in NOD-SCID mice.#R##N#Results#R##N#Following a single dose of IrC™ the active lactone forms of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 were measurable in HT-29 tumors after 7 days. The treatment reduced tumor cell density and increased apoptosis. Hoechst 33342 perfusion and accumulation of 14C-5-FU in the treated tumors increased significantly on days 7 and 14. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of endothelial cells relative to total nuclei in the tumor sections. Pre-treatment with IrC™ (Q7D × 3) followed by 5-FU (Q7D × 3) delayed the time taken for tumors to reach 1 cm3 by 9 days (p < 0.05). IrC™ was just as effective as free irinotecan when used on patient derived xenografts of colorectal cancer.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Treatment with IrC™ reduces tumor cell viability and appears to normalize the vascular function of the tumor after a single treatment cycle. A concomitant increase in the accumulation of a second drug (5-FU) in the tumor was observed in tumors from IrC™ treated animals and this was correlated with changes in vascular structure consistent with normalization. The treatment effects of sequential 5-FU dosing following IrC™ are additive with no additional toxicity in contrast to previous studies where concurrent 5-FU and IrC™ treatment exacerbated 5-FU toxicity. The studies with PDX tumors also indicate that IrC™ is just as effective as free irinotecan on PDX tumors even though the delivered dose is halved."qwqwRobert W.

Using blood samples from infected patients, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is effectively killed in the plasma under defined local infection-inflammation condition, where slight acidosis and reduced calcium levels (pH 6.5, 2 mM calcium) typically prevail. We showed that this powerful antimicrobial activity is provoked by crosstalk between two plasma proteins; CRP∶L-ficolin interaction led to communication between the complement classical and lectin pathways from which two amplification events emerged. Assays for C4 deposition, phagocytosis, and protein competition consistently proved the functional significance of the amplification pathways in boosting complement-mediated antimicrobial activity. The infection-inflammation condition induced a 100-fold increase in CRP∶L-ficolin interaction in a pH- and calcium-sensitive manner. We conclude that the infection-induced local inflammatory conditions trigger a strong interaction between CRP∶L-ficolin, eliciting complement-amplification pathways which are autonomous and which co-exist with and reinforce the classical and lectin pathways. Our findings provide new insights into the host immune response to P. aeruginosa infection under pathological conditions and the potential development of new therapeutic strategies against bacterial infection."qwqwJing Zhang,NUS Graduate School for Integrative Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Jingyun Koh,Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Jinhua Lu,Department of Microbiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Steffen Thiel,Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark;Benjamin Leong,Emergency Medicine Department, National University Hospital, Singapore;Sunil Sethi,Department of Pathology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Cynthia Y.

Linear and nonlinear absorption properties of SD-FLU-SD were investigated with the goals of understanding the nature of one- and two-photon absorption spectra, determining the molecular optical parameters, and performing modeling of the photophysical processes. The optical behavior of this new SD-FLU-SD “hybrid” molecule was compared with its separate squaraine constituent moiety. Linear spectroscopic characterization includes absorption, fluorescence, excitation and emission anisotropy, and quantum yield measurements in solvents of different polarity and viscosity.

Over the last two decades, tumor response criteria have come a long way from purely size-based, anatomic methods such as the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors towards more functional, enhancement- and diffusion-based parameters with a strong emphasis on MRI as the ultimate imaging modality. However, the relatively low reproducibility of those one- and 2D techniques (modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria) provided the rationale for the development of new, 3D quantitative assessment techniques. This review will summarize and compare the existing methodologies used for 3D quantitative tumor analysis and provide an overview of the published clinical evidence for the benefits of 3D quantitative tumor response assessment techniques."qwqwJulius Chapiro;M.

The design which has evolved is a depleted-uranium fueled fast-fission blanket which produces fissile plutonium and electricity. A major objective of the design study was to evaluate the feasibility of producing fissile fuel with laser fusion. This feasibility evaluation was carried out by analyzing the integrated engineering performance of the complete conceptual design and by identifying the required laser/pellet performance. The performance of the laser fusion hybrid has also been compared to a typical fast breeder reactor. The results show that the laser fusion hybrid produces enough fissile material to fuel more than six light water reactors (LWR's) of equivalent thermal power while operating in a regime which requires an order of magnitude less laser and pellet performance than pure laser fusion. In comparison to a fast breeder reactor the hybrid produces 10 times more fissile fuel. An economic analysis of the design shows that the cost of electricity in a combined hybrid-LWR scenario is insensitive to the capital cost of the hybrid, increasing by only 20 to 40 percent when the capital cost of the hybrid ranges frommore » 2 to 3 times more than an LWR.« less"qwqwJ.A.

However, the premise of successful cooperation is that there is a Pareto inefficiency, i.e. if there is scope to make some nations better off without hurting others. This paper presents a first welfare theorem for open economies that defines an efficient benchmark and spells out the conditions that need to be violated to generate inefficiency and scope for cooperation. These are: (i) policymakers act competitively in the international market, (ii) policymakers have sufficient external policy instruments and (iii) international markets are free of imperfections. Our theorem holds even if each economy suffers from a wide range of domestic market imperfections and targeting problems. We provide examples of current account intervention, monetary policy, fiscal policy, macroprudential policy/capital controls, and exchange rate management and show that the resulting spillovers are Pareto efficient, as long as the three conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, we develop general guidelines for how policy cooperation can improve welfare when the conditions are violated."qwqwAnton Korinek

In this paper we investigate the effects of genistein on cell proliferation and differentiation in neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines and its possible mechanism of action. Genistein substantially inhibited the growth of five (N2A, JC, SKNSH, MSN and Lan5) of the six tumor cell lines examined in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of ~5 mg/ml. The exception was GC cells. N2A cells were treated with genistein for 6 days and exhibited morphological features of differentiation, as evidenced by the development of dendritic extensions. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TDT) histochemical staining showed a significant elevation in darkly stained nuclei in genisteintreated N2A cells compared with controls, indicating the occurrence of apoptosis. Fluorescent quantitation of DNA fragments confirmed apoptosis in genistein-treated N2A cells. To further elucidate the possible mechanisms by which genistein modulates NB cell growth and differentiation we investigated the effect of genistein on the activities of PTK and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and N-myc proto-oncogene expression in N2A cells. The results showed that genistein down-regulated intrinsic PTK activity by ~33% and inhibited insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-stimulated PTK activity by 75%. The effect of genistein on the intrinsic activity of MAP kinase was insignificant. In addition, genistein significantly reduced N-myc expression in a dose-dependent fashion. Our study suggests that genistein arrests cell growth and induces NB cell differentiation by mediating apoptosis and modulating PTK activity and N-myc proto-oncogene expression."qwqwA Brown;P Jolly;H Wei

A number of sedimentological techniques were employed to address this question. Samples were taken from the dune top, dune base (of unknown origin), and mid-tide beach area at 30 locations along the seashore for comparison purposes. Cumulative weight percentages for each sample were calculated and plotted on probability paper. The majority of unknown sands have one saltation population, like the dune sands, whereas beach sands characteristically have two saltation populations with a break at or around 2 φ. Statistics show clear separation of the two (aeolian and hydraulic) environments. In all cases, the unknown sands group together with the dune sands, leaving beach sands clearly separate. Linear discriminant analysis and the Mahanalobis  D  2  statistic proved to be conclusive techniques, clearly placing the unknown sands in the dune environment. Heavy/light mineral ratios were compared, indicating that dune and unknown sands are of the same origin. Roundness counts were made, but no statistically significant difference in roundness values was found between the environments. Grain surface textures were studied by the S.E.M. in an attempt to establish distinctive surface feature differences. A definite qualitative difference is observed, but this is not substantiated quantitatively. Structural analysis of the dunes proved to be of little significance because few cross-beds and only a small number of sand ripples were found. Where measured, small ripple numbers indicate an aeolian origin for the foredunes.

Understanding drug movement in association with its size at the single-molecule level and estimating the time needed to reach the targeted organ is indispensable for optimizing drug delivery because single cell-targeted therapy is the ongoing paradigm.

Women provide legitimacy to the political projects of the nation in particular social and historical contexts. This article focuses on the gendered symbolization of the nation through the rhetoric of the ‘motherland’ and the manipulation of this rhetoric in the context of national struggle in Bangladesh. I show the ways in which the visual representation of this ‘motherland’ as fertile countryside, and its idealization primarily through rural landscapes has enabled a crystallization of essentialist gender roles for women. This article is particularly interested in how these images had to be reconciled with the subjectivities of women raped during the Bangladesh Liberation War (Muktijuddho) and the role of the aestheticizing sensibilities of Bangladesh's middle class in that process."qwqwNayanika Mookherjee

micrometeoroid protection technologies. During the 24 solar orbits of the mission, the spacecraft will encounter a thermal environment that is 50 times more severe than any previous spacecraft. It will also travel through a dust environment previously unexplored, and be subject to particle hypervelocity impacts (HVI) at velocities much larger than anything previously encountered. New analytical methodologies and designs have been developed to meet this environment's extreme micrometeoroid protection challenge while also fulfilling the mission's low mass requirement. These new analytical capabilities and protection system concepts could produce similar benefits if applied to Earth orbiting and deep space missions. The SPP dust study was developed to overcome the velocity limitations in the existing micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) analysis capability. In this study, we developed the hydrocode modeling techniques needed to characterize the material behaviors for a high-shock particle impact event. An additional novel development was an algorithm to calculate the particle flux on specific spacecraft surfaces. Our approach predicts particle impacts for a given spacecraft geometry, including the aforementioned effects. In addition, our approach introduces a size-velocity particle correlation, which lowers the shielding needed for a given protection level. This paper covers the new analytical capabilities developed for the SPP dust environment and how they dramatically lower the mass of the protective systems. The paper also discusses the application of these new analytical capabilities to spacecraft protection in the LEO debris field."qwqwDouglas S.

In particular, algorithms that are expressed as compositions of functions operating on series/vectors/streams of data elements are much easier to understand and modify than equivalent algorithms expressed as loops. Unfortunately, many programmers hesitate to use series expressions, because they are typically implemented very inefficiently---the prime source of inefficiency being the creation of intermediate series objects. A restricted class of series expressions, {it obviously synchronizable series expressions}, is defined which can be evaluated very efficiently. At the cost of introducing restrictions which place modest limits on the series expressions which can be written, the restrictions guarantee that the creation of intermediate series objects is never necessary. This makes it possible to automatically convert obviously synchronizable series expressions into highly efficient loops using straightforward algorithms."qwqwRichard C. Waters

Coleridge's mastery of this new study and his search for a new understanding of the Bible on which to ground his faith are the focus of this book. Beginning with an exposition of Coleridge's double role as theologian and poet, Anthony Harding analyses the development and transmission of Coleridge's views of inspiration - both biblical and poetic - and provides a history of his theological and poetic ideas in their second generation, in England especially in the work of F.D. Maurice and John Sterling, and in America in that of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Harding argues that Coleridge's emphasis on the human integrity of the scriptural authors provided his contemporaries with a poetics of inspiration that seemed likely to restore to literature a "biblical" sense of the divine as a presence in the world. Coleridge's treatment of biblical inspiration is thus an important contribution to Romantic poetics as well as to biblical scholarship. His concept of inspiration is also linked directly to his literary theory and thus to the current debate over the reader's relation to text and author."qwqwAnthony John Harding

Properties measured include density, thermal expansion coefficient, glass transformation and dilatometric softening temperatures, transformation-range viscosity, dc electrical conductivity, and helium permeability and diffusivity. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the color of these glasses results from absorption bands at approx. = 407, approx. = 310, and approx. = 250 nm. Each band increased in intensity as the silver oxide content of the glass was increased. The properties of these glasses were consistent with the structural model currently used to describe the structure of alkali borate glasses.

Permanent environmental variances were static for height at sacrum, height at withers and chest depth, increased for body weight and body length on time. Heritability values ranged from 0.2679 to 0.6135 for body weight and Height at withers. Genetic correlations changed between 0.725 and 0.979 in all traits.

While GI symptoms are common at the end stages of many diseases, management must reflect the specific causes of these symptoms in the heart failure patient. Breathlessness, fatigue, limited mobility and depression—all symptoms associated with advancing heart failure—and the treatment of the heart failure itself can potentiate or exacerbate GI symptoms. Early assessment, recognition of the impact and pro-active management of GI symptoms is recommended. Cachexia is common at the advanced stages of many diseases and is associated with poor outcomes for heart failure patients.

'Retro' is the one of the important trends in this century. In the rapidly changing present, the more people want to find a clue to the hope and happiness from the past nostalgia. Reflecting such people's desire, retro fashion has boomed again from 2000 as one of powerful trends.   This research conforms the meaning of retro fashion and characteristic of retro fashion design. And through this processing, it was find that retro fashion design had 20st century retro romantic fahion image . Therefore , in this research, the processing about development of retro dress design of retro romantic fashion image was showed by using CAD.   The results of this study are as followings.   First, Retro fashion is worth the high value of good producr of new and creative for consumers who pursuit tranquil mood in the midist of dailly change.   Second, Nostalgia and revival of style for each 10 years after 1920's is well brought out in Retro trend of modernt fashion. Also decorative and elegant style are marked by retro romantic fashion mood.   Third, fashion design using the computer graphics was presented by application retro romatic image. It is mixed with elegance and modernity based on retro feeling,   It is suggested that computer graphics was effectively used in fashion design development to the newly romantic and modern style through 1950'-1960' intimate retro fashion image."qwqw유진경

Heat exchanger plates (5) inside are held vertically, on arms (4) attached to the annular support. Manifolds incorporated in the support circulate thermal fluid and connect to coaxial inlet and outlet pipes forming the arms and connecting into the internal circulation spaces of the plates. The heat exchanger is a completely independent unit. Its external surface has a protective coating. Preferred Features: A central, vertical rotary agitator promotes contact between reagents. Heat exchange plates have a circular support fastened to their lower ends. The plates, seen in plan view, are orientated at 0-70 degrees w.r.t their radii, in the direction of agitator rotation. The annular support is clamped between the cover and vessel, together with resilient sealing rings, by screws. Coaxial pipes forming the arms are connected to inlet and outlet stand pipes for thermal fluid (7, 8). Internal surfaces of vessel and cover have a coating like that of the heat exchanger.

These rituals include school assemblies, the prefect system, and school uniforms. This article recounts a recent attempt on the part of a New Zealand secondary school to resolve a challenge to the tradition of compulsory school uniforms. The course of events contained many of the elements of participative decision making, and is none the less significant for having failed to bring about immediate change. The article also questions the validity of some assumptions which are implicit in much of the contemporary writing about educational decision making."qwqwJohn M.

It identifies challenges faced by the seconded prison probation team; highlights tensions between the standpoints of prisoners, volunteers, the Prison Service and the Probation Service; suggests useful ground rules for visiting schemes and examines implications for anti-discriminatory practice. Lessons learned from the exercise inform practice at the task level - how to organise an efficient visiting scheme - and raise fundamental issues about the value base underpinning probation practice in prisons. The probation team, motivated by humanitarianism, was eager to undertake innovative work. It was not that simple. The learning proved painful. Probation officers were forced to question their use of power and authority, their priorities and their role in a system where service users sic were routinely disempowered and oppressed."qwqwSusan Barter

Two flavonol glycosides were isolated and identified from ethyl acetate soluble fraction, which showed the strongest antioxidant activity ( = 4.33 ). Isolated two compounds have shown strong free radical scavenging activity. Especially, quercetin 3-O-glucoside ( = 2.60 ) was more active than -tocopherol ( = 4.67 ). Total phenol and flavonoid contents were the highest to 4.17 and 1.14 mg/ml in the ethyl acetate soluble fraction. In addition, ethyl acetate soluble fraction was shown to the strongest -glucosidase inhibitory activity ( = 137.88 ) among the fractions. The results suggest that leaves of H. rhamnoides could be a potential source of natural antioxidant."qwqwJi-Won Lee;Ju-hee Park;Ju-Sung Kim;Eun-Young Choi;Sang-No Han;Eun-Soo Seong;Chang-Yoen Yu;Yong-Soo Kwon;Myong-Jo Kim

Thus, in the present study we present a simple method to measure mass of biological particles; the spore mass of 23 fern species was measured and related with spore size and type. Species could be grouped according to spore mass into three size classes 4–19 ng (twelve species), 37–46 ng (six species), and 69–90 ng (five species), which were not necessarily correlated to their level of ploidy. The highly variable spore mass of some species such as Blechnum falciforme might indicate the production of spores of different ploidy level. The average spore mass of all 23 species of 33.9 ± 6.03 ng is comparable to the mass of pollen grains, but three times lower than those reported for airborne orchid seeds. The average length of polar and equatorial axes of fern spores was 37.4 μm and 48.0 μm. The mean water content of fern spores was 1.7% and independent of storage time. The correlation between spore mass and the length of spore axes did not differ between monolete and trilete spores. Although fern spores do not differ from pollen grains in average mass, they might be less dense because of their high lipid and low water content, both promoting increasing airlift."qwqwFelipe Gómez-Noguez,Doctorado en Ciencias Biológicas y de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, Av.

In contrast, wireless sensor networks are easy to deploy and flexible in application so that the network can adjust to the individual structure. Different sensing techniques have been used with such networks, but the acoustic emission technique has rarely been utilized. With the use of acoustic emission (AE) techniques it is possible to detect internal structural damage, from cracks propagating during the routine use of a structure, e.g. breakage of prestressing wires. To date, AE data analysis techniques are not appropriate for the requirements of a wireless network due to the very exact time synchronization needed between multiple sensors, and power consumption issues. To unleash the power of the acoustic emission technique on large, extended structures, recording and local analysis techniques need better algorithms to handle and reduce the immense amount of data generated. Preliminary results from utilizing a new concept called Acoustic Emission Array Processing to locally reduce data to information are presented. Results show that the azimuthal location of a seismic source can be successfully identified, using an array of six to eight poor-quality AE sensors arranged in a circular array approximately 200 mm in diameter. AE beamforming only requires very fine time synchronization of the sensors within a single array, relative timing between sensors of 1 µs can easily be performed by a single Mote servicing the array. The method concentrates the essence of six to eight extended waveforms into a single value to be sent through the wireless network, resulting in power savings by avoiding extended radio transmission."qwqwChristian U.

The free volume was selected as an internal state variable to depict the shear-band nucleation, growth, and coalescence with the help of free volume theory, which was incorporated into the ABAQUS code via a user material subroutine UMAT. Under cyclic loading, the shear banding initiation mainly stems from the microstructure inhomogeneity in BMGs and, further, the effect of applied strain amplitude and cycling frequency was discussed. The present simulations will shed some light on the fatigue damage mechanisms and fatigue life evaluation of BMG structures."qwqwYunpeng Jiang

This paper investigates a method of separating the nitrogen compounds as sediments to provide valuable chemicals and clean fuel. Indole contained in coal liquids was photo-oxidized in carbon tetrachloride. The presence of galvinoxyl in the photo-oxidation process affected the formation of sediments in such a way as to suggest a radical reaction process. Whilst increased indole concentration led to increased sediment formation, the percentage yield was lower due to increased solubility of the sediment in highly polar solution. An optimum concentration is therefore indicated."qwqwKoji Ukegawa;Akimitsu Matsumura;Kazumasa Yazu;Yoichi Kodera;Teruo Kondo

Herp, an ER membrane protein upregulated by ER stress, is implicated in regulation of ERAD. In the present study, we show that Herp interacts with members of the ubiquilin family, which function as a shuttle factor to deliver ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for degradation. Knockdown of ubiquilin expression by small interfering RNA stabilized the ERAD substrate CD3{delta}, whereas it did not alter or increased degradation of non-ERAD substrates tested. CD3{delta} was stabilized by overexpressed Herp mutants which were capable of binding to ubiquilins but were impaired in ER membrane targeting by deletion of the transmembrane domain. Our data suggest that Herp binding to ubiquilin proteins plays an important role in the ERAD pathway and that ubiquilins are specifically involved in degradation of only a subset of ubiquitinated targets, including Herp-dependent ERAD substrates."qwqwTaeyeon Kim,Department of Biochemistry and Protein Network Research Center, College of Science, Yonsei University, 134 Shinchon-Dong, Seodaemoon-Gu, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea;Eunmin Kim,Department of Biomedical Sciences, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-040, Republic of Korea;Sungjoo Kim Yoon,Department of Biomedical Sciences, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-040, Republic of Korea;Jong-Bok Yoon,Department of Biochemistry and Protein Network Research Center, College of Science, Yonsei University, 134 Shinchon-Dong, Seodaemoon-Gu, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea

Hence, more reliable and faster TSV filling by Cu electrodeposition is required. Our approach to improve Cu gap-filling in TSV is based on the development of new organic additives for feature filling. Here, we introduce our achievements from the synthesis of choline-based leveler to the feature filling using a synthesized leveler. The choline-based leveler, which includes two quaternary ammoniums at both ends of the molecule, is synthesized from glutaric acid. The characteristics of the choline-based additive are examined by the electrochemical analyses, and it is confirmed that the choline-based leveler shows a convection dependent adsorption behavior, which is essential for leveling. The interactions between the polymeric suppressor, accelerator, and the choline-based leveler are also investigated by changing the convection condition. Using the combination of suppressor, accelerator, and the choline-based leveler, the extreme bottom-up filling of Cu at trenches with dimensions similar to TSV are fulfilled. The mechanism of Cu gap-filling is demonstrated based on the results of electrochemical analyses and feature filling."qwqwMyung Jun Kim,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Youngran Seo,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Hoe Chul Kim,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Yoonjae Lee,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Seunghoe Choe,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Young Gyu Kim,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea;Sung Ki Cho,School of Energy and Integrated Materials Engineering, Department of Energy and Chemical Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, 61 Daehak-ro, Gumi, Gyeongbuk, 730-701, Republic of Korea;Jae Jeong Kim,School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Process, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea

Preappliance and postappliance EMG levels in four experimentals that had been fitted with functional appliances were compared against the background of EMG levels in controls without appliances. The insertion of two types of functional appliance to induce mandibular protrusion was associated with a decrease in postural EMG activity of the superior and inferior heads of the lateral pterygoid, superficial masseter, and anterior digastric muscles; the decrease in the first three muscles was statistically significant. This decreased postural EMG activity persisted for approximately 6 weeks, with a gradual return toward preappliance levels during a subsequent 6-week period of observation. Progressive mandibular advancement of 1.5 to 2 mm every 10 to 15 days did not prevent the decrease in postural EMG activity."qwqwBarry J. Sessle;Donald G. Woodside;P. Bourque;S. Gurza;G. Powell;J.

revegetation efforts will depend upon the planted species’ resilience to climate change. Many widespread species grow across a range of climatic conditions and, thus, may possess adaptations that could be utilised to improve climate resilience of restored ecosystems. Species can achieve a widespread distribution via two main mechanisms; (1) by diverging into a series of specialised populations, or (2) through high phenotypic plasticity. The extent to which populations are specialised or plastic in response to climate will determine the seed-sourcing strategy required for optimal restoration outcomes under a changing climate. We examined genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity in two widespread Eucalyptus species (E. tricarpa in southeastern Australia, E. salubris in southwestern Australia), to determine the nature of adaptation to climate in these species, and whether genomic screening might be a useful tool to assess climate adaptation. We examined nine populations of each species across climate gradients and, for E. tricarpa, trees originating from the same populations were also studied in two common garden field trials. We characterised responses in functional traits relevant to climate adaptation, including leaf size, thickness, tissue density, and carbon isotope ratio (δ13C). Genetic variation was assessed with genome scans using DArTseq markers, and ‘outlier markers’ were identified as being linked to regions of the genome that are potentially under selection. Evidence of both plastic response and genetic specialisation for climate was found in both species, indicating that widespread eucalypts utilise a combination of both mechanisms for adaptation to spatial variation in climate. The E. tricarpa common garden data suggested high plasticity in most of the measured functional traits, and the extent of plasticity in some traits (e.g. leaf size and thickness) varied among provenances, suggesting genetic variation for plasticity itself. In E. salubris, most functional traits showed little variation across the gradient. However, water use efficiency appeared highly plastic, as determined from the strong correlation between δ13C and recent precipitation (R2 = 0.83). Both species showed spatial partitioning of genetic variation across the gradient, and data for E. salubris revealed two distinct lineages. The genome scans yielded 16,122 DArTseq markers for “Lineage 1” of E. salubris, of which 0.1% were potentially adaptive ‘outlier loci’, and 6,544 markers for E. tricarpa, of which 2.6% were outliers. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) analysis showed that the outlier markers were correlated with climatic variables, and some were also strongly correlated with functional traits. An ‘Aridity Index’ was also developed from the CAP analysis that has potential as a tool for environmental planners to use for matching seed sources to target climates. Widespread eucalypts are likely to possess a capacity to respond plastically to a changing climate to some extent, but selection of seed sources to match projected climate changes may confer even greater climate resilience. Further study of the mechanisms of plasticity in response to climate may improve our ability to assess climate adaptation in other species, and to determine optimal strategies for ecosystem restoration and management under climate change."qwqwMargaret Byrne;Suzanne M.

Our results indicate that equity retirement plans present a lower withdrawal index when compared to that of fixed income plans. Furthermore, the higher the statement sending frequency, the lower the withdrawals from open retirement plans. However, withdrawals from equity retirement plans tend to increase when statements are sent to investors more frequently. These phenomena can be explained by behaviorist theories, such as the concept of myopic loss aversion. In a context where loss aversion is present, the more frequently the investor evaluates his or her portfolio, or the shorter the investment horizon, the less attractive he or she will find investment in assets with a high rate of return and risk, such as equities.

In the full sentence, we suggested that in the future, agents to reduce cell death could be delivered in combination with a more advanced version of the gene augmentation therapy that reaches not only remaining rods and extrafoveal cones but also foveal cone photoreceptors."qwqwArtur V.

The coatings of composites (Al–Mg and Al–AlMg) were annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere for four hours. Post-annealing caused Mg in the coatings to diffuse into the Al matrix by eutectic reaction between Al and Mg. For Al/AlMg multicoatings, porous layers in the coatings were formed by post-annealing (diffusion of Mg into the Al matrix). Therefore, processing parameters such as particles and coating method can be used for controlling the size and distribution of pores in cold sprayed coatings."qwqwH. Lee;Kai-Hsiung Ko

In the paper, the minimisation of the total required reactive-power installation is formulated as a nonlinear-programming problem. Based on certain specific features of this problem, a new solution technique, which results in a considerable reduction of computational effort, as compared with general optimisation techniques, is developed. An additional feature of this technique is that it can be used in conjunction with any standard a.c. load-flow program. The technique is applied to a typical network to bring out the advantages of this approach. An extension of this technique for cases where the voltage restrictions have to be satisfied for two or more loading conditions is also presented."qwqwA.

One of distinct features of the technique is the arrangement of the gas-solid separator which is located at the outlet of the riser, where it may bring forth some advantages such as the simple structure, the higher separation efficiency, the lower pressure drop, and flexible operation. To meet these requirements, a novel gas-solid separator incorporating the inertial and the centrifugal separation mechanism was figured out. Based on the previous study on the structural optimization and the performance investigation, the flow field of the proposed separator was studied by using five-hole probe under the operating condition of the inlet gas velocity 10~22 m?s?1. The main characteristic of this type separator is that gas flowing around the central pipe is mainly along tangential direction, the closer to the central pipe the higher the velocity is. Based on the experimental results, the structure advantages and disadvantages were discussed. At the same time, the proportions of gas flux passing through the slots and under central pipe space were calculated, respectively. Furthermore, the formula for predicting the tangential velocity distribution was given."qwqwShi Ming-xian,State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil, China University of Petroleum, Beijing 102249, China)

Use of an Integrated UASB-duckweed #N#ponds system for domestic wastewater treatment linked to tilapia aquaculture was investigated. The#N#treatment system was efficient in organic matter removal during the entire year, while nitrogen,#N#phosphorus and faecal coliform removal were negatively affected by the decline in temperature in#N#winter. Most ofthe nitrogen removal was achieved by plant uptake (81%) while 14.5% and 4.5% of the#N#removal was due to denitrification and sedimentation, respectively. The treatment system provided#N#effluent quality and duckweed biomass suitable for reuse in tilapia aquaculture. The nutritional value.#N#fresh duckweed was significantly better than for wheat bran and similar to the commercial feed wher#N#used in combination with treated sewage from the duckweed ponds.#N#Using treated sewage enhanced the yield of tilapia and makes the combined feed of treated sewage#N#and duckweed similar in results to the fishmeal-based commercial feed. At un-ionIsed ammonia#N#concentrations above 0.1 mg UIA-N F^ the chronic ammonia toxicity to duckweed-fed tilapia#N#significantly reduced the growth. Other water quality parameters (pathogens, nitrite, low dissolved#N#oxygen) had synergistic effects on ammonia toxicity. Similarly, ammonia, nitrite and low dissolved#N#oxygen had synergistic effects on the faecal coliform count in tilapia tissues and organs. Therefore pf#N#treatment of sewage is preferable before use in aquaculture for maximum yield and quality assuranc*#N#The optimum feeding rate was 25 gram fresh duckweed per 100 gram of live fish weight at 16-25 °C.#N#The results on apparent duckweed digestibility showed a negative effect of the bulky volume of the ;#N#fresh duckweed at 40% inclusion while at 20% the digestibility coefficients were similar for fresh and#N#dry duckweed.

This is because the use of asphaltenes from crude oils may help to overcome the lack of source rock samples in basin analysis when reliable predictions for the generation of hydrocarbons are required. Potential source rocks are described in terms of quantity, quality and level of thermal maturity of organic matter, but pertinent source rock information is frequently absent because exploratory drilling does not reach deeply buried source facies. Even if the source is reached, samples are often inappropriate for reliable oilsource rock correlation due to low maturity or organic facies variation."qwqwManoj Kumar Sarmah

The open-field-line region can be identified as the area bounded by the auroral oval, namely the polar cap. The polar-cap geometry varies considerably with the orientation of the IMF and magnitude, particularly when the IMF Bz component is positive and large. The corresponding exit points of the open-field lines on the magnetopause are also examined. The results will be a useful guide in interpreting various upper-atmospheric phenomena in the highest-latitude region of the Earth and also in observing chemical releases outside the magnetopause."qwqwS.-I.

The change in retractive force which occurs when the solvent around the strip is replaced by a solution containing a polymeric solute, which does not penetrate into the strip, is inversely proportional to the number average molecular weight of the solute. The instrument can be operated at elevated (∼90°C) as well as at room temperature and can yield two or three molecular weights in a working day. Although calibration by means of a sample of known molecular weight is the best operating procedure, it is also possible to put elasto-osmometry on an absolute basis. To this end the network parameters of the swollen silicone strip have to be determined. Examples of both procedures are given for a number of samples of polystyrene and polyethylene, ranging from 2 000 to 14 000 in molecular weight. The theory indicates that with isotropic silicone rubber strips molecular weights up to at least 40 000 should be attainable. The instrument yields erroneous results at molecular weights below 5 000 because of penetration of solute into the swollen strip."qwqwH. J. M. A. Mieras;W. Prins

This complexity has created management challenges and raises concerns for the sustainability of our marine natural resource systems. This article contributes to SES fisheries research and management in two ways: first, it enhances our understanding of lobster fisheries as complex social-ecological systems, focusing on the Southern California Spiny Lobster Fishery (SCSLF) as a case study. Secondly, it demonstrates a methodological approach for assessing component interactions in SESs that can be used to assess the sustainability of management approaches. The first contribution involves the systematic review of the literature on lobster fisheries management and their SES characteristics. The review results are then used to modify and extensively define the diagnostic SES framework for specific use in lobster fisheries. For the second contribution, we demonstrate how to operationalize the modified framework for the diagnosis of a real-life case, using the SCSLF as an example. This involves framing the SCSLF classificatory diagnosis for analysis of the stakeholder-comprised management group of the SCSLF as a social-ecological action situation. This analysis is aided by the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, a SES-imbedded tool used in our case to assess sustainability in resource management systems through critical analysis of stakeholder and resource system interactions. More generally, we find that research in lobster fisheries could benefit from broadening its scope of analysis, as overly narrow research foci have worked to limit the production of more holistic SES knowledge. Our exemplary analysis of the LAC's management of the SCSLF shows that the SES contains multiple components which have been associated with sustainable outcomes elsewhere; however, the fishery still faces many obstacles, including how to adapt to future challenges. Our results contribute to developing a holistic methodological approach for operationalizing SES framework research into practical fisheries management."qwqwStefan Partelow,Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology (ZMT), Bremen, Germany;Chad Boda,Center for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS), Lund University, Sweden

Both low and high molecular weight polyalkylene terephthalates are improved with regard to physical properties and dimensional stability through addition of these small quantities of these specialized monoclinic materials. Under controlled conditions of injection and forming, anisotropic properties may be obtained as a consequence of the effect and extent of the crystallization of the polyalkylene terephthalates which has been promoted by these strongly active nucleating agents. In addition to the improvement of the physical properties of the molded article, the use of these specialized nucleating agents in suitable particle size yields a significant shortening of the retention time of the injection molded material in the mold, this being an item of economic significance. An important aspect of the invention is the added capability of polyalkylene terephthalate crystal orientation by controlled application of magnetic forces to these nucleated compositions, and particularly (a) when such nucleating agents are ferromagnetic in themselves and (b) whether ferromagnetic or not, the preferred nucleating agents are more forcibly aligned into a desired direction (thus promoting crystallization of the polyalkylene terephthalate also in the desired direction) by the action of magnetic fields of force applied to the composition in the molding cycle in the presence of sweeping agents of fibrous and/or acicular nature taken from the class of non-metallic and/or metallic ferromagnetic materials. Not only are the specialized monoclinic nucleating agents useful for promoting crystallization of polyalkylene terephthalates when such nucleating agents are used in small percentages, but in much larger percentages they can be used as mineral fillers to yield high strength, dimensionally stable, clean surface parts obtained with a molding cycle time of short duration."qwqwEugene Wainer
