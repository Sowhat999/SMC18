The command used for the above is:
for i in $(awk 'NR>1{print $1}' linking_relations_col.txt | head); do grep "id\": \"$i"  mag/mag_papers_*; done

The command to find number of authors:
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do jq '.authors|length' aminer/aminer_papers_$i.txt >> aminer_number_of_auth.txt; done

Print json files columnwise for aminer data (qwqw is the column seperator)
jq  '. | "\(.id)qwqw\(.title)qwqw\(.authors|length)qwqw\(.doi)qwqw\(.isbn)qwqw\(.issn)qwqw\(.lang)qwqw\(.n_citation)qwqw\(.issue)qwqw\(.url)qwqw\(.volume)qwqw\(.page_start)qwqw\(.page_end)qwqw\(.year)qwqw\(.venue)qwqw\(.pdf)qwqw\(.references)qwqw\(.keywords)qwqw\(.abstract)"' aminer/aminer_papers_4.txt > aminer/aminer_papers_4.col.txt

Print json files columnwise for mag data (qwqw is the column seperator)
jq  '. | "\(.id)qwqw\(.title)qwqw\(.authors|length)qwqw\(.doi)qwqw\(.fos)qwqw\(.doc_type)qwqw\(.lang)qwqw\(.n_citation)qwqw\(.issue)qwqw\(.url)qwqw\(.volume)qwqw\(.page_start)qwqw\(.page_end)qwqw\(.year)qwqw\(.venue)qwqw\(.publisher)qwqw\(.references)qwqw\(.keywords)qwqw\(.abstract)"' mag/mag_papers_4.txt > mag/mag_papers_4.col.txt

Get the flattened author,org for each paper id:
jq -c '{id: .id, authors: [.authors[]|join(",")]|join(";")}|[.id, .authors]' orig.format/aminer_papers_3.txt 2>/dev/null | sed -e 's/\[//g' -e 's/\]//g' -e 's/\"//g' -e 's/,/qwqw/1' > col.format/aminer_3.auth.col.txt 

A finding: some records have no authors. For instance, in aminer_papers_3.txt 25029 records have no authors.

Merge the col and auth.col files into one file.
for i in $(seq 0 29); do awk -f merge.awk aminer/col.format/aminer_papers_$i.auth.col.txt aminer/col.format/aminer_papers_$i.col.txt>aminer_papers_$i.allcols.txt; done
for i in $(seq 0 19); do awk -f merge.awk mag/col.format/mag_papers_$i.auth.col.txt mag/col.format/mag_papers_$i.col.txt>mag_papers_$i.allcols.txt; done


== Workflow for Data Preprocessing ==

Step 1. Download and unzip the data bundle
    wget https://academicgraphv1wu.blob.core.windows.net/aminer/mag_papers_1.zip
		unzip mag_papers_1.zip
		
		AND for aminer papers
		wget https://academicgraphv1wu.blob.core.windows.net/aminer/aminer_papers_1.zip


Step 2. Prepare the data in column format
   Step 2.1 Extract all but the authors data and put in column format
   for i in $(seq 20 39); do ./jq  '. | "\(.id)qwqw\(.title)qwqw\(.authors|length)qwqw\(.doi)qwqw\(.fos)qwqw\(.doc_type)qwqw\(.lang)qwqw\(.n_citation)qwqw\(.issue)qwqw\(.url)qwqw\(.volume)qwqw\(.page_start)qwqw\(.page_end)qwqw\(.year)qwqw\(.venue)qwqw\(.publisher)qwqw\(.references)qwqw\(.keywords)qwqw\(.abstract)"' mag/mag_papers_$i.txt > mag_papers_$i.col.txt; done
	 AND for aminer, it goes like:
	 jq  '. | "\(.id)qwqw\(.title)qwqw\(.authors|length)qwqw\(.doi)qwqw\(.isbn)qwqw\(.issn)qwqw\(.lang)qwqw\(.n_citation)qwqw\(.issue)qwqw\(.url)qwqw\(.volume)qwqw\(.page_start)qwqw\(.page_end)qwqw\(.year)qwqw\(.venue)qwqw\(.pdf)qwqw\(.references)qwqw\(.keywords)qwqw\(.abstract)"' aminer/aminer_papers_4.txt > aminer/aminer_papers_4.col.txt

	 Step 2.2 Extract authors data in a seperate column format file
	 for i in $(seq 20 39); do ./jq -c '{id: .id, authors: [.authors[]|join(",")]|join(";")}|[.id, .authors]' orig.format/mag_papers_$i.txt 2>/dev/null | sed -e 's/\[//g' -e 's/\]//g' -e 's/\"//g' -e 's/,/qwqw/1' mag/mag_papers_$i.txt > mag_papers_$i.col.auth.txt; done
	 SAME for aminer

	 Step 2.3 Merge the files obtained in 2.1 and 2.2 to obtain the final allcols file
   for i in $(seq 20 39); do awk -f ./code/merge.awk mag_papers_$i.col.auth.txt mag_papers_$i.col.txt>mag_papers_$i.allcols.txt; done
   SAME for aminer #NOTE: must remove any " chars from the id fields of all files involved.

Step 3. Remove duplicate records from the dataset based on linking relationships. Aminer data was chosen to be removed for duplicate entries since it seems to have less information about papers when I spot checked.
    for i in $(seq 0 153) ; do (awk -f filterdup.awk ../linking_relations.txt ../aminer_papers_allcols/aminer_papers_$i.allcols.txt > aminer_papers_$i.allcols.excl.txt) & done


Total number of records: Aminer has about 155+ million records; Mag has about 165+ million records. Totaling about 321+ Million records. Out of these, about 64 million records are common, making them 257+ million unique records.

Some papers may be appearing in both datasets but are not listed in the linking_relations database. For instance, the highest cited paper appears twice:
243576 53e9af26b7602d97039635be Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual J. Sambrook;E. F. Fritsch;T. Maniatis "molecular cloning","biotechnology","genetic engineering" BioScience
241606 a3aed21d-9e15-4a61-90df-fc39285bf7f3 Molecular cloning : a laboratory manual Joseph Sambrook;E. F. Fritsch;Tom Maniatis ["genetic engineering","molecular cloning laboratory manuals","my publications","biologia molecular","clonagem molecular","techniques","molecular cloning","biotechnology"] null

There are a lot of patents in the data. About 14 million of them are likely patents.

Collect all the keywords from all records:
 awk -F'qwqw' '($18!~/null/ && $7~/en/ && $18~/[A-Za-z]/){print $18}' mag_papers_allcols/mag_papers_*.allcols.txt aminer_papers_allcols_excl/aminer_papers_*.allcols.excl.txt > all_keywords.txt #Exclude records that have null in keywords, are not in English, and have non-English characters and numbers.
 sed -i 's/\"//g' all_keywords.txt  #remove quotes
 tr "," "\n" < all_keywords.txt>tmp && mv tmp all_keywords.txt #put all keywords in newlines, one for each
 awk '{a[$0]++} END{for (k in a) print a[k],k}' all_keywords.txt > count.txt #count frequency 
 sort -r -n -k1 count.txt > tmp && mv tmp count.txt #sort them


Extract keywords and compute frequency out of the 180 highest cited works: papers+patents all.
 awk -F'qwqw' '$9!~/null/{print $9}' best_papers.txt |sed 's/\"//g'|tr ',' ' '|tr -s ' '|tr ' ' '\n' | awk '{a[$0]++} END{for(k in a) print a[k],k}' | sort -n -r -k1 > best_papers_keywords.txt 

Generate a dot compatible ref-graph:
awk -F'qwqw' 'BEGIN{print "graph{\n", "    rankdir=LR;"} $8!~/null/{$2="\""$2"\"";print "    ",$2,"--", "{",$8,"};"} END{print "}"}' best_papers.txt | tr ',' ' ' > ref_graph.dot

Generate the graph:
dot ref_graph.dot -obest_papers.svg -Tsvg

Interesting Trivia:
awk -F'qwqw' '$2~/[rR]amanujan/{print $2}' ../aminer_papers_allcols_excl/aminer_papers_*.allcols.excl.txt ../mag_papers_allcols/mag_papers_*.allcols.txt | wc -l
3345

There are 3345 papers that has Ramanujan word in their titles.

#Papers with just one author:
awk -F'qwqw' '$3==1{a++} END{print a}' aminer_papers_allcols_excl/aminer_papers_*.allcols.excl.txt mag_papers_allcols/mag_papers_*.allcols.txt
107689674

#Papers by country, may not be most accurate
awk -f prob3.awk ../countries/countries.txt ../aminer_papers_allcols_excl/aminer_papers_*.allcols.excl.txt ../mag_papers_allcols/mag_papers_*.allcols.txt | sort -n -r -k 1 > papers_by_countries.txt

I had to manually tweak about 20 aminer records where the year was in YY format. I changed it to YYYY format. It was mostly between 2012 and 2017

Find top 10 trending words by year:
awk -f code/prob4_p3.awk aminer_papers_allcols_excl/aminer_papers_*.allcols.excl.txt mag_papers_allcols/mag_papers_*.allcols.txt
for i in 18?? 19?? 20??; do (grep -o -E '\w+' $i | tr [A-Z] [a-z]|sed -e 's/null//g' -e 's/^.$//g' -e 's/^..$//g' -e 's/^[0-9]*$//g' | awk NF | fgrep -v -w -f stop_words.txt |sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10 > trending/trending.$i.txt) & done
