\section*{Introduction}

I report on my response to the SMC 2018 Data Challenge 4--Acedamic Data Mining.
I address the challenge by employing the classic Linux tools and a modern HPC
parallel workflow platform.

This report describes the tools used, their rationale, Solutions to the
problems and a glance at the results. Detailed solutions and results may be
found here: https://github.com/ketancmaheshwari/SMC18

\section*{Tools Used}
Classic Linux tools such as \texttt{awk}, \texttt{sort}, \texttt{grep},
\texttt{tr}, \texttt{sed} and \texttt{bash} are used.  The \texttt{jq} tool was
used for initial data conversion from json to awk-suitable table format. 

\subsection*{Rationale}
For the bulk of processing, I used awk. Awk is used for its powerful
textprocessing and concise expression properties. 

\section*{Data and Problems}
The data was originally spread across two sets of 167 json files (total 334
files) each containing a million records. The data also consisted of a file
that recorded the list of duplicate records. I used an awk script to exclude
those duplicate records from the aminer dataset. As a result, there are over
256 million (256,382,605 to be exact) records to process.

The json files were converted to tabular files with 19 original columns and one
additional column called ``num\_authors" showing the number of authors for a given
publication record.

\section*{Solutions}
\subsection*{Auxiliary Data}
In addition to the existing data, I used three lists: 1) List of cities of
world with population 100,000 or above; 2) List of all countries of the world;
3) List of all the universities and research institutes.
